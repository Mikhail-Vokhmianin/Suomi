1,"I think this complement could be taken the wrong way, but these interviews remind me of Charlie Rose.  Minimalist studio, no distractions, interesting guests, calm delivery of thoughtful questions.  Lex is definitely filling a space that needs to be filled.  Well done"
2,It took me 11 hours to do the math but he said ‚ÄúLex‚Äù more than any other guest combined 
3,"I love Stephen Kotkin. One of my fav historians, he should be much more widely known."
4,This interview was a certified classic!
5,"One of my favorite guests you‚Äôve had on previously. Looking forward to listening to this one. Thanks for the great content, Lex."
6,"What an excellent interview. What fine people! Thank you for sharing your expertise and analysis, and something of yourselves."
7,"Having an interview with Stephen Kotkin and Oliver Stone to discuss Russia in such a short time period is a major achievement. I'm not sure exactly how to put it, but it can't be understated just how much insight we received in such a short time period."
8,"I‚Äôm blown away with the compassion, depth and overwhelming insight this conversation brings to the table. What a masterpiece! Thank you so very much, Stephen and Lex! ü´°"
9,I especially appreciated Dr. Kotkin‚Äôs take on how to live a purposeful life.  What an amazing scholar and human being.
10,"Lex I‚Äôm so glad that you allowed Stephen the time to fully develop his arguments, and Stephen, thank you for the compassion and logic."
11,This is the 2nd time I listen to this pod cast and I am in awwww as to all the points covered in such an amazing way.    I want to read all of Steven's writings.
12,"This was a great conversation. I enjoyed it. Your guest is very knowledgeable and I appreciated your ability as an interviewer to listen objectively. My only critique comes early in the conversation during the Putin vs the West timestamp. The United States does have some publicly noted history in attempting to destabilize perceived enemy nations and install pro-western regimes, especially if those regimes have a lot of assets to be acquired the biggest being oil, and utilize it to our gain. Even if everything Stephen says is true about western Europe and United States being very welcoming to Russia throughout the years it does not change the fact that Putin is aware of the West's previous tactics in other countries. This coupled with his own training in ideological subversion, and economic warfare when he was an officer with the KGB it would no doubt make for a very heightened and suspicious individual who is aware Russia posses a lot of assets to be gained by west Europe and The United States, and he has seen we are not above destabilizing a country and leaving it's citizen's in shambles as a means to our own gain. This is by no means a support for Putin or the horrors of autocracy. However I think it needs to be noted because without all the nuances the bigger picture cannot be objectively and precisely formed. If the United States wants larger countries that posses a potential superpower risk such as Russia or China to become our allies then we need to prove we are universally trustworthy.
edit: 
And overstaying our time in the middle east, while attempting a regime change in Iraq and then our hasty sloppy withdrawal from Afghanistan was not and is not a good universal look. Not to mention our dependency on the abuse of Asia's cheap labor force so that we can live privileged lives filled with inexpensive things. Let's always promote freedom and democracy but also do our best to look at the biggest picture possible when doing so, because if we don't our freedom might be coming at the cost of someone else's enslavement."
13,"As an 80 years old Dane living in Denmark on a small Island called Fejoe, I am trilled to listen to this interwiev. IT gives me an outwiev og the greater political situation. I am indeed thankful for this posibily."
14,"What a relief listening to this after the Stone thing.
Thx for the great podcast"

24,Thanks for your work Lex!
25,This conversation is just fantastic. Thank you.
26,Heartfelt intro.  I feel but a piece of that tracing my ancestry that has history in both countries.  I lived in Moscow for a year and visited 3 weeks in Kiev.  I too have a heart for both and support your quest.  Godspeed Lex.
27,Thank you for putting out Stones and Kotkins interviews on this topic. Greetings from Germany!

32,"Wow, I really enjoyed this podcast without realizing this is outside my immediate interests. Thanks Lex and Stephen!"
33,"Lex podcasts are great,  love the way he allows the guest to have a platform to speak, I only wish he would push back more against all arguments. It seems there are too many opinions interjected in these discussions that go unchallenged."
34,Take a drink every time Stephen says ‚ÄúLex‚Äù. You‚Äôll have a 2-day hangover.
35,"Fascinating to hear after Stone. The objective vs. subjective view. It's interesting to imagine him talking about Russia when he mentions the United States, and vice versa."
36,Great interview! I truly appreciated hearing this.
37,Very one-sided interview and he contradicts himself a lot. I dont know how you guys are saying this is the best interview ever
38,"This is a very educational and great interview. No rush, good thoughts and positivity through the dialog. Thank you Lex and Stephen!"
39,"Very educational interview with a great mind. I listened to this interview twice. If nothing else Lex, you attract the greatest minds in western culture. You are learning too, keep up the good line up of guests for your interviews."
40,"Me, a Chinese, listening to him talking about China at 1 AM in the morning. I've watched all your clips about China and communism"
41,One of the greatest minds in contemporary geo politics. First time ive listened to a 2 hour plus podcast from beginning to end. A truly brilliant mind analysing some truly intricate problems.
42,Thank you so much! One of the greatest interviews I recently watched
43,"Thank you Stephen Kotkin, you are brilliant."
44,One of my favorite guests!
45,2:24:00 This part was funny. It's nice to have a response to Oliver Stone.
46,Your doing a wonderful job Lex. Thank you for the so interesting educational interviews .
47,"Another wonderful lecture, thank you Lex.  I am a little smarter now."
48,Awesome view you keep expanding in amazing ways the picture gets more clarity with every interaction
49,"Lex, thank you for this great interview.
You will probably have no problem with your visit to Ukraine."
50,"So this was really all about Lex Fridman. I knew it!!
Seriously, though. This was a great interview."
51,‚ÄúNavalny is a second most important person‚Äù

54,"Hey Lex, thanks for another great interview. You look sad or stressed, I hope you are alright. All the very best. You really are doing a great thing. Stephen Kotkin was a legend as always, I hope you have him on again."

Always interesting, insightful and refreshing."
59,"For some reason, I like to listen to this man go on long tangents on your Podcast, while you listen."
60,"This is amazing Lex, thanks a lot for this beautiful content."
61,Brilliant podcast!
62,"Lex, I can't tell you how refreshing it is to hear your conversations and for your calm presence in the midst of the chaotic life topics of discussions you present. Many heartfelt thanks."
63,"Came here from spotify to say this dude is based AF, great podcast!"
64,I love how Lex brings people on to present both perspectives of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. This was a fascinating podcast.
65,Lex has surpassed Rogan in terms of interviewing
66,"Downright incredible conversation. From just listening to Stephen, I know that his books are fantastic reads. His ability to explain complex geopolitical machinations (Putin‚Äôs calculations for continuing the war) was so clear and concise that a child could understand it."
67,"I‚Äôm learning more and more about Russia ,22 years ago I met a Russian paleontologist who is a United States citizen, when I ask her about Russia back then all she said was not good. She left Russia and became a United States citizen before I met her.   This guy is saying everything I‚Äôve been thinking and I just started watching the stuff but I seen it now ."
68,–û–≥—Ä–æ–º–Ω–æ–µ —Å–ø–∞—Å–∏–±–æ!Ô∏è‚Äç
69,Excellent interview.
70,I hope that Prof. Kotkin will soon be able to finish the 3. (final) Vol. of his excellent Stalin biography. A great scientist. Thank you!
71,Very intellectual guest which takes good points in history and can se hole view of world.
72,"Get Victor Davis Hanson on the podcast, a classical historian would be very informative here and in general. I rate him on a par with Mr Kotkin, no disrespect implied at all. This is a superb episode."
73,Outstanding Interview Lex and incredibly insightful and informative. Keep up your amazing work
74,Thank you so much for your conversation!
75,Hi Lex! Really like your podcast and interesting guests. Joe Rogan's podcast used to be my favorite but nowadays he mostly has comics and fighters on which isn't nearly as interesting as the good ol' folks you're having on. Cheers.
76,"""NATO is a defensive alliance""  this guy is as full of it, as what he claims Oliver Stone to be"
77,"I can't believe he said ""Nato does not attack"""
78,"We love you too, Lex. You‚Äôre the voice of a generation. Keep doing what you‚Äôre doing and don‚Äôt let anyone or anything ever hold you back. Please be safe on your travels. The people need you."
79,"Thank you, Lex. You are a wonderful human. Much love from Bucharest."
80,Stephen is like the Joe Pesci of historians =)
81,Thank you Lex and Stephen. Much love!
82,"Dear Hanne your comments give me hope for the positive power of this net and the reach, impact and significance of what Lex brings to us. Thanks !"
83,He hasn't won this room over with his reality tv production.
84,"Thanks a lot Lex for both Mr Stone‚Äôs interview and Mr Kotkin‚Äôs interview.
It is great to be able to see both sides and try and understand the current circumstances with their help.
I wish you a great trip back to the land of your ancestors."
85,NATO is a defensive alliance? Some historian. Lybia? Serbia? Defensive?
86,One of the most informative and insightful interviews about this subject I have seen. Bravo 
87,"Fantastic interview, thank you both!"
88,he's the perfect antidote
89,Good job Mr Fridman
90,Wow! What an intro! Prayers up Lex! Ô∏è
91,"""All war is based on miscalculation, but not everybody is punished for their miscalculation"""
92,I read both of his books on Stalin since the last podcast. Huge fan of Kotkin!
93,I've been wondering if Putin has a favorite Tsar. I'm hoping it's Alexander the first
94,Great interview. Though Kotkin is even more fascinating to listen when speaking at his own pace from a podium.
95,"One of the most informational podcasts I have ever listened to regarding Ukraine.  Hearing about Putin, and his historical links to Stalin, was an amazing listen."
96,"stephen kotkin,thanks for your inside and wisdom."
97,"Good one Lex. I agree with the guy maybe 20%, but I‚Äôm glad I got to hear this."
98,Kotkin never disappoints. He understands things very well and doesnt mince words
99,Thanks for inviting him Lex Love from Poland
100,Would have been very interesting if Lex could interview John Mearsheimer on this subject as well.
101,"I love you all too, Lex Fridman.

Let‚Äôs keep the love going‚Ä¶. There‚Äôs nothing more important."
102,"I have listened to it twice now because it is that good. One of the best conversations, and probably the best conversation I have listened to over the Ukraine/Russia conflict."
103,Thank you Mr Kotkin
104,"Damnit Lex, you've done it again... GREAT podcast!"
105,Wow. Amazing interview. Thanks lex and thanks Stephen 
106,"This is the best podcast ever aired.  I am sending this link to all in my sphere.  Thank you, Lex."
107,"Only a Russian could give the introduction Lex opens this podcast with.
Best wishes"
108,Would love to see this guy debate Andrei Martyanov 
109,Thanks to Lex Fridman for this amazingly important and fascinating interview with Stephen Kopkin
110,Would love to see Maren Altman on the podcast.
111,If you had Steven on every week I‚Äôd be faithfully watching every episode. Thank you from the bottom of my heart. Touching ending Ô∏è
112,"Lex, your knocking out the park with these guests. Thanks you for your work. Much love brother."
113,"Be safe in your travels, Lex. YOU are one my favorite human beings, despite not knowing you in person. Keep bringing light to the world."
114,"You‚Äôre a light in this world allowed us to learn and explore.
"
115,Great interview! Thank you for the enlightenment you have brought to me!
116,Sharing this excellent histrionic piece.
117,"Essential follow up to the Oliver Stone interview. Thank you for the balance Lex and humility not to colour the experts‚Äô voices.  Subsequently, I come away with the perspective that Stone‚Äôs assessment, whilst well-informed on a first-hand basis is, as a result, deeply biased and without historical foundation."
118,Excellent interview and the mutual respect is apparent. Well done and thank you!
119,Lex is delivering on educators that Joe lacks nowadays.  Keep it up!!!
120,"Your fusion of humility, compassion and sensitivity is evolving the phenomena of podcast interviewing. It‚Äôs attuned to a global intellectual zeitgeist. Compulsive listening every time. 

This interview is another treasure: nearly three hours of Kotkin‚Äôs acute analysis and insight.

We might not agree with everything he says but his knowledge imparted to us - for free - is priceless. The same can be said of many of your guests.

Lex, do not underestimate the contribution your podcasts are making across the globe. For this we are hugely appreciative. 

Your emotional investment in Ukraine - Russia is particularly heart-wrenching. We implore you to stay safe as you travel both countries, and we understand your desire to embark on this journey. Trust you will find what you‚Äôre searching for and give support to those you visit.

Ultimately, we look forward to your return, your insights and your continued expansion of our knowledge via your interviews. 

I write from Africa and end off with an ancient farewell that we say to a friend when departing: ‚ÄúWalk gently. Walk in peace.‚Äù"
121,Oliver Stone is no expert...keep the experts coming
122,"Watching and listening to ""Eli from Russia"" gives me a better understanding of life and happenings in Russia than this Kotkin guy."
123,Incredible interview - thanks Lex!
124,"Mr. Kotlin's patience is also admirable, the way he gently, kindly corrects the flawed questions, the same way a loving father tries to educate his slightly idiotic son."
125,Mr. Kotkin always has me riveted!
126,"This introduction and ending brought me to tears. This was not just an insightful conversation with good historic information, but raw, courageous sense of impending potential uncertainty. Thanks for sharing this one Lex."
127,Thank you for your work! From Russia with love :)
128,Thank you . This was an incredible interview
129,That intro about Mr. Fridman traveling to Russia/Ukraine hits hard.
130,For a second I was worried he might not remember Lex's name.
131,Kotkin seems totally unable to see the world from a global south perspective.
132,This was the best episode yet. As someone who enjoyed the original focus on machine learning it‚Äôs great to see this transcend into something so much more. Great job and amazing guest.
133,"I need to start watching these interviews instead of just listening, this whole time I thought this was Joe Pesci!"
134,Coming from the Oli Stone interview. Really nice to get both sides. Media tends to skew things and yet i get a sense i can trust Lex here.
135,"37:30 Agree with most of the podcast so far, except comparing the invasion to a woman in New York.."
136,Really enjoyed this one even though the discussed topics were often very sad.
137,Again top class quality!!!!
138,Thanks for this. Love his first interview and I've been wanting to hear his thoughts on everything happening
139,The loop of insanity may have been introduced in the middle but in the mind it has been extended prior the beginning and requires examination and resolve to exit the beaten path of humanity
140,"What a fabulous interview.  I've been watching two years now, and catching up on old ones, this is one of the best I've seen. Stephen Kotkin just lays it all out and seemed to be spot on in almost everything he said."
141,The first 10 minutes tell you everything you need to know about Russia.
142,I would be great to see Kotkin and Stone discussing these relevant political issues in one room and producing insights mediated by Lex. Two brilliant separate interviews regardless.
143,"For me, more common sense that what Oliver Stone offered."
144,"Great interview, I couldn‚Äôt agree more with everything he was saying to include the US in Iraq in 2003. I was there with 1st Mar Div 3/12 L battery I was a gunner artillery crew member, the war was a complete waste of human life, we created the vacuum that formed ISIS. As Americans we own this. However Russia is basically taken Americas reasoning for war to justify the war in Ukraine just listen to their media and how they‚Äôre selling it."
145,"It is beautiful almost to watch two people I respect greatly show so much humility and respect toward each other.
Intelligent conversation is how we get beyond the strife.
Thank you both for moving the world forward with this conversation."
146,"I'm grateful to have known you as a professional, as well as a human being, using this podcast a tool to see the war through yours and others perspective. You are a great man who seems to understand the true consequences of your direct action. Regardless, this makes you authentic, leagues above the rest in terms of dignity and respect. Please continue to do greatness my friend, it suits you well."
147,Thx for the content! its a valueable opinion.
148,Wow I read one of his books when I took a seminar on Russian history.
149,This man is right on and IÔ∏è like how he doesn‚Äôt accept the bs justification pushed by pro-Russian agents and sympathizers.
150,Prof Kotkin has terrific insight into  Putin and this horrendous war....great teatcher!
151,I love how he is saying ‚Äòlex‚Äô hahahaha
152,"Thank you Lex for this interview. I disagreed hard with Oliver Stone, yet it was important to do it.  Please continue covering this and other topics, you are probably one of the best interviewers out there right now."
153,"Thank you for sharing this conversation.

I think Kotkin is really downplaying how influential the invasion of Yugoslavia in directing Putin's decisions.

I think the west has more responsibility to bear than we would like. Much like the rise of Hitler, neighbouring countries had a big role to play in his ascention."
154,Worth every minute!
155,"Bring Yanis Varoufakis on your podcast if possible. He has a good insight on Russia - Ukraine war and global order that leads to it. Also, he is an economist."
156,Lex I would say bringing the Oliver interview is good
157,Brilliant conversation! And once again Fridman allows the guest to speak instead of constantly interrupting and reducing complicated ideas to sound clips.
158,Amazing interview Lex  I'm always interested in people who are educated in Soviet history. Keep doing what you are doing. Thank you
159,"I met an 87 year old Ukrainian immigrant the other day.  He came here to California from Odessa 30 years ago. We worked as election volunteers together in Los Angeles. He spoke Russian much better than English. When asked how he felt about the conflict, he stated he didn't like what Zelinsky was doing.  He grew up in the USSR and always identified as Russian.  He's also Jewish, but identifies first as Russian. He said he understands why Russia felt threatened.  He's very aware of fascism in Ukraine.  Perhaps if he saw this video cast, he's change his mind.

160,"This must be one of the best interviews of all times, all dimensions and galaxies!! This man is a living encyclopedia and knows how to communicate."
161,"The ""metaphor"" of the rape was so off, it was hard for me to take him seriously after he said this.  Having said that the man does have a lot of valuable information.  Will listen to this again."
162,"My favorite, so far."
163,"Keep it coming! It takes Courage!
But be it Stone or others.....always viewed through Neo liberal sunglasses.Try a different shade... that takes Courage too."
164,Is this man a historian or a hypnotist? It took two hours but I really liked when he finally opened up in hour two. The world like conversations are complicated and sometimes difficult. Maybe we should stop putting time limits on conversations so we can get to the humanity. Sincerely
165,"It's interesting to note that in 1991, when Ukrainians voted on whether or not to leave the USSR, the vote in favor of independence was also in the 90%+ range. Zelensky is popular because his actions are in line with the will of the Ukrainian people. Yanukovich got ousted because he tried to thwart it."
166,"Fascinating, passionate, knowledgeable speaker. Really enjoyed this."
167,"I wonder if Prof. Kotkin's description of Iran's leader as being ""whatever incarnation of the the supreme leader"" was a dig at both Khomeini and Khamenei because both of them have helped to destroy what was once a country that was flourishing and on their way to big success in the mold of a South Korea."
168,He sure likes Lex! Great interview btw.
169,I was also struggling to think of what you were gonna say to the rape analogy.... Very good interview 
170,I close my eyes and wonder how Joe Pesci finds the time.
171,"Heavy material!!! Thanks,"
172,"What a great way to explain everything! I am with this man 100%, thank you so much for inviting him!"
173,"This channel is a refuge for intellectuals, philosophers, artists and those on the scientific  rim.  Always thought provoking, invariably deep and utterly amazing. Do you ever sleep?"
174,My new favorite podcast!
175,"Almost every single argument he makes against russia, you could make identically against the usa"
176,"Stalin must be one of the most interesting characters in history and I only managed to read half of the first book of his biography how could an author make such an interesting life so boring, it takes a certain talent."
177,"Be safe Lex, this world needs you‚Ä¶"
178,The excellent timing of this interview as the geopolitical and economical world is entering a very dangerous and difficult period ahead. Let us hope that the Worlds  leaders have studied history and will not commit mistakes that dragged humanity to two devastatingWorld wars
179,Kotkin is pure wisdom. Maybe we should have him take a talk with Putin and Lavrov?
180,"Great interview, will need another when/if the war reaches a conclusion"
181,Great podcast!
182,Mr Stephen is one of the few brilliant minds of today world !!!
183,"Spicoli said, ""Learning about Russia. Having some food."""
184,"Thx for this amazing session with Mr Kotkin Lex. An amazing follow up from Mr Stone, two excellent episodes. My only complaint it didn‚Äôt go long enough! I could listen to Mr Kotkin and his knowledge on Russia/Ukraine and the world in general for hours."
185,"Lex these were the poorest set of questions that you could have prepared. 
- every country has a right to choose which alliance to join BUT NOT AT AN EXPENSE OF SECURITY OF OTHERS. Why you haven't asked about that MAJOR part? 
- poisoning with NOVICHOK. Where are all the evidences that NOVICHOK was in fact been used? Where the criminal records of it to be used? Where the autopsy results? 
I love your podcasts but this one in particular had a very poor set of questions. 
-International treaties signed by USSR/Russia and NATO. Why haven't you asked about numerous breaches of these treaties by US/NATO?"
186,"Superb conversation, a sublime melding of high intellects and good hearts."
187,Wonderful interview with the brilliant Stephen Kotkin. A little correction though: Russia received VERY LITTLE net financing (after debt repayment) from the West.
188,"Lex I feel you didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the picture Stephen was drawing in front of you. Oliver May have been one sided as well, but Stephen definitely was doing war propaganda. I saw you felt overwhelmed by what he said you felt sick. You did a great job with those two interviews. But I ask myself why you didn‚Äôt confront Stephen more with some of the points Oliver told us. You confronted Oliver sometimes. But you felt like overwhelmed by Stephens blindness. Well in his case it may have been just the best you could do to let him talk and talk and talk and draw out the hole terrible picture he has in mind."
189,Id really like to hear his opinion of the Saudi relation with the west
190,Great interview! Thanks  üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶
191,fresh breath of air after Propaganda by Oliver Stone.
192,One of the best interview's I've seen on the invasion of Ukraine! I still remember writing a paper on Stalin using Stephen's first volume for my world history class in high school.
193,"A most balanced and insightful opinion of the world.
Good will prevail ,"
194,"Hey I just came to say how much I admire your patience with your guests.  This guy was really annoying.  ""Lex, Lex... Lex.."""
195,Giving Ukraine $100 B a year would be more than doubling its government's prewar budget.
196,This was a brilliant discussion! Mr. Kotkin has provided insight into this conflict thanks to his profound knowledge of history and con text. People should be paying attention to this and not to some'soundbite' claptrap.
197,He reminds me of one of the invaders in Home Alone
198,Historians have their own interpretation of what happened in the past.  Interviews with people who have lived through those horrors would be crucial to obtain real life.
199,"Ultimately, Kotkin holds a deeply biased view of the situation and very often seems unaware of his numerous hypocritical statements. The analogies employed were often farcical, misplaced and inappropriate. Furthermore, it's one thing to have an opinion on a topic, but to disseminate that opinion as if it were fact is misguided, even arrogant."
200,"Thank you so much for being brave, idealistic, and concerned Lex ‚Äî  please take care of yourself and please know that your offering so much to your many followers here. I appreciate the way your able to articulate with great ethical candor and i respect the way you are able to create a safe environment that cultivates an intimate, and thoughtful forum for communication related to these very relevant topics."
201,"The depth of his insights and  the clarity and simplicity at which he articulates those insights is insane.  

You  got all the answers you were seeking on all those credible news channels all this while and still did not get.

You got all those answers in this one podcast. 

Thanks Lex."
202,"Kotkin's definition of ""the West"" is bizarre and ahistorical.
Japan is ""Western?"" Really? What percentage of the Japanese population would call themselves ""Western?"""
203,"I like this Joe Pesci look a like person, he is a good fella :-)"
204,"Not only is the subject fascinating, but this man is a great interview. I've not properly understood Russia until now."
205,I love this man OMG
206,"Incredible conversation, incredible guest, I could listen for another 5 hours"
207,Best podcast I have ever listened too.  Thank you both.
208,Thank you for having Stephen on after Oliver Stone. Nice to hear a coherent thought of the Russia invasion!
209,Great interview. Is it me or does this guy sound like Joe Pesci?
210,"Had me a little worried after OS.  Glad to hear this perspective, makes more sense to me.  But it is also nice to hear there are other thoughts out there‚Ä¶"
211,"""Stephen Kotkin is aN historian specializing in Stalin and Soviet history."" Sure.!     And his anti-Russian bias is very obvious. I got more and more angry as the interview dragged on. He is a clever and sophisticated man obviously.. but also obviously very very ignorant. I am posting this and shutting the video down after he gave credence to the Novichok lie. 57 minutes of wasted time. Push back harder please Lex."
212,Again thank you Mr. Fridman for another brilliant podcast that educates many of us. (Holland)
213,"You did not do a great job at pushing back here, Lex. Why did you never ask him about US interference in Ukraine prior to the invasion? Or about US support for Maidan revolution, plans for US missiles within Ukraine prior to the invasion, US Congress changing an earlier prohibition to fund right-wing extremists in Ukraine prior to the invasion?"
214,I lost Stephen somewhat when he supported Ukraine taking back Crimea with no care for the diversity of thought of those living in Crimea and the level of support for allignment with Russia.
215,As we can see today...nearly whole Donbas belongs to Russians. Turkey soon will sign several economic agreements with Russia. Turkey doesnt agree on Finland and Sweden joned Nato. I like the joke about Warsaw and hope noboddy gets the idea for Poland  fights Russia. We have  complicated history with Russia but at the moment I dont want to be on a side of sfastika ukrainian batalions fasist state with jewish actor in charge. Im thinking the  west has lost this battle
216,This one is    
217,Why is there no time stamps? Can you mention the date of the interviews in your introduction?
218,"Wonderful, rich discussion of much depth and wisdom. Thank you."
219,"Brilliant convo with respect, love, and empathy."
220,This was such a great episode.
221,Kotkin is one of those westerners that only see the victims of communism but never mention the victims of western imperialism that are still accumulating.
222,"I must say this was the must insightful and enjoyable podcast that I ever watch on an current topic.
Mr kotkin is an extraordinary communicator made every topic so easy to understand,great conversation lex thoroughly enjoyed this episode."
223,I didnt know Joe Pesci was an expert of Russian history.
224,Mr Kotkit is much better informed and has built a way more solid and grounded knowledge on Russia and Putin than O.S. ever can dream of.
225,"His arguments against Russia are Valid, but justification for West's aggressiveness is invalid."
226,imagine Lex starts saying Stephen's name every other sentence as well
227,In 28mins it semestre I.possible t√¥ find an appropriate point t√¥ start debunking this speech. It is mind blowing!
228,When he said ‚Äú freedom is better than unfreedom lex‚Äù he sounded like an older Michael Malice
229,when you put all the speculations together you get an interview like that... really a lot propagandist words.. nothing else
230,"An in-depth analysis from an educated person, a historian, who understands the russian history, culture, ego very well. And then you have OS, a movie maker, who spreads pro-russian propaganda on his twitter."
231,The amount of times he says Lex's name makes me think he's trying some kinda PUA/NLP move
232,Great combo to the Oliver Stone conversation! Really enjoyed hearing Kotkin's educated view on this!
233,Best propaganda so far. Nicely packed 
234,"Fascinating interview, but I do have a problem with one thing he said. PJ O‚ÄôRourke was not a comedian. He was a political satirist, social commentator, and journalist. Calling him a comedian is an unintended insult and also a very confineing label that doesn‚Äôt come close to covering who he really was.

Calling PJ O‚ÄôRourke a comedian would be like calling Will Rogers or Andy Rooney a comedian."
235,"i will have to watch the stone interview, i will probably agree more with him!
last comments 2:33:49 i totally agree."
236,The subtle attempts of Lex trying to play care of Putin‚Äôs apologist failed miserably today.
237,Most important prodcast i ever seen in this year
238,Bless you Lex. Going to listen now. That sigh around 2:32 is everything . He's not interviewing here but processing his pain.
239,"Best recipe for immortality: delay your time of death until you witness the disintegration of the Russian army faced with the Ukrainian one. Right, Mr. Kotkin, just you wait !"
240,"This was probably the best conversation I have heard on the war and it's context this whole year.  He politely refused to speculate on his answers and brought some very important insights to the table. I loved to hear his view and some of the facts I was not aware of before this podcast. Thank you Lex, thank you professor and all the best to both of you in your own ""silly"" pursuits."
241,"This guy uses a condescending tone to say everything , I‚Äôd love to talk to one of his kids if he actually had any."
242,"By the end of this episode, I couldn't help but conclude that Klotkin is, in the end, carrying water for the Empire. Brilliant mind, but either not objective, or has some blind spots."
243,Can you please do research  on Lincoln Bain in the Bahamas üáßüá∏   Please Lex
244,"ich habe hier in Deutschland noch nie ein Interview auf diesem Niveau geh√∂rt.Der gegenseitige Respekt, die Wertsch√§tzung anderer Sichtweisen u.auch der immer wieder mal durchscheinende philosophische Hintergrun"
245,"The US is to blame 
They toppled the elected and this while Russia was having their olympic. CRAMEA was referendum and the people wanted to join Russia."
246,Thank you both for this amazing interview. I'm watching it for the second time in 3 days already.

248,"I appreciate Lex having someone on to counter Oliver Stone, but I don‚Äôt see how this fella is any different than your run of the mill neocon or neoliberal. This just as easily could have been an interview with Bill Kristol or Hillary Clinton. Would not be surprised if Raytheon funded this guy‚Äôs book, which I certainly will not be buying."
249,"Need to interview Eva Bartlett, Patrick Lancaster for a balanced view"
250,"Very good interview and Mr Kotkin made some remarkable statements, shedding light on complex situations and providing a different perspective. Unfortunately, at times he sounded too much like an Ukraine / Zelensky fanboy in my opinion."
251,"Thank you Gentlemen, Stephen & Lex, for this powerful, deep and broad insight. May Almighty God bless you and your positive influence to the world. And Lex, may you have a safe trip visiting Ukraine."
252,"Another great interview.  Keep up the good work, this was very informative."
253,"Wow! What a wonderful and insightful discussion. Stephen Kotkin in my view is spot on. He undeniably has an incredible perspective. I may be biased but for me, his arguments are solid. Thank you for another great podcast Lex!"
254,Its amazing how both Oliver Stone and Stephen Kotkin live in their opposite bubbles.
255,"Love you buddy, and I am worried about your safety."
256,"The guest discutst me at a visceral level. I do want to listen to the point of view im less inclined to agree with but this guy makes it so hard for me to empathize with his side,even though he has a couple of good points"
257,is this a professor for sure? why is he telling Putin to look on Twitter whether he is losing the war or not? it's very funny to hear
258,"Be safe out there Lex, the world is in need of beautifull souls like yours Ô∏è"
259,Stephen Kotkin's sanctimonious western moralizing is frightening.  He's so out of touch with today's realities IMO.  I can't bear to listen anymore. Give me Oliver Stone any day!
260,"Thank you for this interview, it was worth every minute."
261,Protect Mr Kotkin at ALL COSTS
262,"A lot of people do say China invests in businesses and nations over seas so they become dependent on the China economy for continued success. So maybe Russia has a point, they get money sort term but pay for it longterm, just an idea."

266,great podcast as usual....stay safe lex!
267,Feels like Lex is fighting his ideas so much more that Oliver Stone‚Äôs
268,"A very interesting discussion, but the analogies of MR Kotkin, are skewed and are clearly biased reasoning, smooth but biased.I hold no brief for either Russia or NATO, but history has shown that human nature is what it is. One who feels threatened  will react. We can use flowery words and rational  arguments but human nature always takes precedent. Russia will flatten Ukraine and the world, inclusive of Russia, will pick up the pieces  and move on."
269,Let please Oliver Stone listen to this.
270,"Thank you lexfridman for this conversation. You are very welcome to #ukraine, and if you planning to come to #odesa it will be a great pleasure and honor to meet you and show you our lovely city!"
271,Why is Catkin so great to listen to but so tedious to read?
272,"Thank you so much, for everything. You are a hero to me and inspire me every single day to be a better person."
273,One of Lexs best episodes yet!
274,"He is a little too triggered and bias for me. I liked Oliver Stone's points of view more. 
It's great the way you have guests that counterpoint each other. Great job Lex."
275,Kissenger has come out after this interview and said Ukraine is losing and should negotiate BTW.
276,"One would and should ask a very basic question... If Russia makes those geopolitical ""choices"" and that has nothing to do with their culture/mentality then how come they keep making those choices? At what point you say it is not a matter of choice?"
277,"Someone show this interview to Oliver Stone, please."
278,"Just great as usual with Kotkin! Lex, please, Tim Snyder next!"
279,Kotkin thinks it's about moving chess pieces on board and that there will be limited cost and consequences in supporting more military action against Russia.  Historians have never made leaders.  It's diplomacy only that saves this situation.
280,"Yes yes yes
I've been waiting for a new Stephen Kotkin interview for atleast over a month
& Been waiting for him to be on lex's show for way longer
Cannot wait to watch this"
281,Great points Mr. Kotkin!!
282,57:00-59:00 The most important part of the podcast
283,Introduction was ominous
284,"And in the end admits- logically, Putin is not Stalin and Iraq was a 'mess.' It is a mess when the US does the blunder but it is exactly opposite to the characterization of Putin's mess- crime."
285,Stone got owned hard
286,Kotkin and Lex ‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt hit play fast enough! Thank you Lex‚Ä¶you‚Äôre a scholar and a gentleman.
287,"Wonderful interview with a thoughtful guest, and an excellent antivenom to the Oliver Stone ridiculousness."
288,I'm surprised to see so many positive comments. I love your interviews. This would one seemed too much like propaganda from a salesman. That comment about the rape showed the bias and emotional words chosen to sway.
289,He might be a good historian but he has little understanding of future.
290,This interesting person tells the truth from his logical western side of view.i am sure all is not so bad as was painted in the picture.but great podcast.Lex Maladiec
291,"1:37:50 what do the ukraine need military support from the west for, apparently the farmers can knock back tank units with pistols and a shotgun found in the shed!"
292,That was wildly inspiring and informative
293,"So he disagrees with some of the common possible explanations as to why Russia invaded Ukraine, but offers no explanation of his own beyond saying that's just what Russia does."
294,"Not done watching it, but, although i dont think it is right to say Russia had to invade due to NATO expansion, i dont think the reasonning that Kotkin put forward is that good. Referring back to 17th century would make every country a warmonger, especially since conflict was seen in a different light back then.  Referring to the right of every country to choose their own alliance is true and overall desirable, but the cuban missile crisis was a thing that the USA didn't accept, nor would they accept an overall alliance of cuba with another power not aligned with them.

That does not make Putin's invasion of Ukraine legitimate, but i feel his points are poor there. Here is how i'd put it. The USa and Russia are 2 persons with a long rivalry, and russia perceives that their rival is trying to pull/convince/turn Ukraine into a member of its group. Russia reacts wrongly by attacking Ukraine to chain her and prevent that (especially if you consider concepts like ""Russia cannot be a great power without Ukraine""). Still a wrong and criminal reaction, but a better analogy than the rape of a woman by an unknown man."
295,My cousin Vinny explains getting poor to defeat Putin
296,"What do you mean I'm funny Lex?  Like the way I talk? Funny how? Funny like a clown, Lex? Do I amuse you, Lex? How am I funny?   (this podcast was incredible btw)"
297,‚ÄúThe money disappeared‚Äù‚Ä¶.fails to mention that Russia paid back the IMF not only for them selves but all countries that separated from the union‚Ä¶lol
298,"Godspeed Lex, our hearts go with you"
299,"2:24:25 nails all these ""predictions"" and models. They always assume that ""everything else remains constant"" and everything is never stays constant."
300,"great - a real service to all of us, supplying much needed insight into what really makes russia tick, and a perfect introduction to stephen kotkin - a definite contributor to the positive human race"
301,It's just annoying how Mr Kotkin is just talking from a position of righteousness almost patronising Lex and any other different perspective to his view
302,"Wish someone with a better counter to Oliver Stone would have followed his shameful interview. This dude's got the right idea for sure, I'm just not so much a fan of the way he's placing things."
303,"I am Russian, Russian theoretical physicist, applying for postdocs abroad. Even spoke with Lex on clubhouse about this. First and for all, I condemn the invasion. Despite the fact that the analogy with a raped girl is sure pictorial but unfortunately not valid. Ukraine is not just a girl walking around. They are neighbors. And isn‚Äôt it conventional in our society that we are supposed to be at least in a friendly relationship with our neighbors? 
During the last 8 years Ukraine has been banning Russian artists, comedians (with Ukrainian roots and relatives there). Let‚Äôs consider football games (before Feb 24,22) where Russian fans always supported Ukrainian teams (brother nation) and in the meantime Ukrainian fans were always aggressive towards Russians. It is not highlighted in the Western news how aggressively they acted. Also Ukrainian soldiers 8 years have been shooting Donbass (their own citizens). Not that angelic. Did you know that Organization of United Nations came to Donbass and reported there were not Russians? Basically Ukrainian army has been shooting their own people. Okay, they have a right. It‚Äôs their own country. From my perspective it is amoral but again, they can do it, why not. Now, you have a neighbor whose president before Feb 24 came to Europe, shook a hand with the American representative and claimed that they would be in NATO and start developing a nuclear weapon. The weapon which presumably they could use against Russians. Since they already showed their unfriendly initiatives during the last decade.

To sum up, I am not protecting Putin, as I mentioned of course it is his fault and it is terrible that we engaged in the war. It is a tragedy. However, the point of message was to show how the ‚Äúraping‚Äù analogy is not helpful to understand what happened. 

PS For the sake of logic and good dialectic arguing, try not to use analogies because analogy doesn‚Äôt prove anything. Some analogies are just wrong. Unfortunately they are colorful and emotional, that‚Äôs why people are fallen for them"
304,"He lies more than he breathes. 
Thanks for the interview"
305,"2:09:25 ...‚Äùso then would you like reparations or you want to kill people or do you want to fist fight the leaders who screwed you over, or just yell at them? And do you speak for yourself or the Russian people?‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd are you for-real mad or are you using this shit as an excuse to just get more power?‚Äù

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôd say."
306,"Lex, thank you so much for this important interview."
307,"its simple but far from easy:  government by the people through a living evolving constitution, adherence to the rule of law so created.  which is all built on the free and fair election.  as you guys say.  thanks for this."
308,"Stephen is amazing, all without notes. Thanks Lex"
309,"If NATO doesn‚Äôt attack others, who attacked Yugoslavia 1999"
310,This guy was interesting for the first 40 mins. Then just rambled on without regard to Lex's questions.
311,"I think, a person who talks so one-side-ly, shold not be called a historian, but a propagandist ."
312,"Lex, your humility and optimism is so refreshing. Thank you for your podcast and these marvelous interviews. Stephen Kotkin is so mesmerizing and your questions to him were a true delight. I love how he addresses you by name as he answers. He has a very personable way of discussing things. It was over 2 hours of an interview and yet it went by too quickly."
313,I feel humbled now...  no more needs to be said...
314,"A border war between two oligarchs should not be the premise for WW3. 
Kotkin is resonating the same Siren song as Zelensky."
315,"Mr Kotkin makes valid and good points about Russia and the free exchange of ideas in the west but he seems less than honest as he ignores the Monroe Doctrine established long Before the USSR and under which the slaughter of innumerable human beings and the traumatization of tens of millions took place including more recently the bloody overthrow of the Democratically Elected govt of Allende. The US record makes the events of Hungary. Checkoslavika etc look very mild by comparison. 

It is fine in a comfortable position in life to talk about ""free institutions"" and they are very valid points but tell that to the millions 
across Latin America butchered, raped, traumatised and terrorised directly and indirectly by the most powerful State on earth. 

The good and humanity enhancing tecord of the USA and its people is on the record but the blood stained record of the USA under the heading of ""bringing democracy"" is a deep and burning injustice and while holding no candle for Putin it was ""bleeding obvious"" what was going to happen in Ukraine with thousands of dead and maimed Russian speakers in Donbass from 2014 and no Minsk accord as WAS AGREED by Ukraine but Not a word about this and more is allowed in the ""Free"" mainstream media of the USA or the EU where you are a either with us or you are a Putin bot or stooge.  It is like a black and white John Wayne Hollywood movie, ""goodies here  baddies there""  and that should terrify all sentient beings when such a mass generated mentality is alloyed with the real possibility of activated nuclear weapons of mass destruction by design or in error,  and there is no rewinding of that tape reel like in Hollywood."

318,I love how he addresses lex like they‚Äôre having a disagreement the whole time
319,Want to have a real discussion about Ukraine Lex?  Then invite Andrei Martianov to your show.
320,"I absolutely love the way Lex brings us not only one, not only two, but in fact thousands of perspectives of the same story. The story of mankind."
321,"I disagree with the guest, I think I should be able to claim that a sovereign nation is a national security threat to me and then annex it. I could really use an entire country to myself, especially post-COVID..."
322,"Kotkin-Oliver Stone debate, sir Lex make it happen"
323,"Your podcasts are great, but this was different because of the guest. I could not listen to mr. Kotkin when he was interviewed by the ""Uncommon knowledge"" and was hoping that he will be able to present himself and his point of view better in this interview. Unfortunately, it did not happen. I was not able to listen to the end and am very surprised to read so many positive comments. The man is arrogant . I thought he was very disrespectful to the host and to the audience by constantly saying ""Lex, are you ..."" He sounded as he was lecturing the host of the podcast. As someone who was born and lived half of my life in the former USSR and another half in the United States, I think that Oliver Stone has a better understanding of Russia and its government than mr. Kotkin ."
324,Good interview and I like the historical references but he‚Äôs drank the Kool-Aid in terms of believing some of the ‚Äúfacts‚Äù that he uses.
325,I enjoyed the interview a lot! I liked that the topic of demographics was touched on. I think the demographic crisis in Russia was one of the factors that pushed the start of the war in Ukraine.
326,"I was disappointed to learn that the rocket systems which the US is providing the Ukrainians and the rocket systems donated by one other country only amount to a total of 8 systems in toto.  The Ukrainians need about 100  systems to oppose the Russians.   I don't know whether there are plans to send more later (though they are needed as soon as possible), but what is being sent now are simply inadequate."
327,"I'm wondering if Kotkin hit every single propaganda talking point? ""blockade"", ""illegal invasion"", ""Putin Autocracy"", ""Ukrainian democracy"", ""war of aggression"""
328,"Wars only have political ends? Again, some historian. WW2 in Europe ended with a battlefield victory."
329,"As a poor American, I am now twice as poor not defeating Putin"
330,‚ÄòHow to Win Friends and Influence People‚Äô‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶a self-help book that Putin didn‚Äôt read.
331,it's absurd how good of a storyteller Stephen Kotkin is. I want him at my bedside (altho I suppose I'd never fall asleep).
332,"For those leaning on Kotkin rather than Stone, you'll be sad when you understand that Stone's agenda is finding the truth, and Kotkins agenda is well... political and pro-USA"
333,"I think he continually mistakes his wishes for reality. It is the problem of historians, that to write history, they need many years after reality happens. We will have to interview him again, in 10 years, so that he can tell us what he saw."
334,"From a former supporter of Navalny: once he started taking money from the US, that's the exact moment my support for him came to an abrupt stop. Someone taking money from Russia would not be able to operate in the US and expose the corruption of high level political figures with the intent to destabilize the political system, and I do not see why Russia should treat foreign agents such as Navalny any differently. While he had at least some political power and did not take money from the West Russian law enforcement was very lenient, to the point of letting him go on probation when a western company filed a lawsuit because he defrauded them when he was a lawyer. But once he started to effectively work for US Dept of State, his credibility was shot even among his staunchest supporters. I'm not even going to bring up his Nazi past (although you can look it up if you'd like). The way the rest of his team behaves now makes me even more sure that withdrawing my support of their organization was the right decision. They are openly anti-Russian now. Not just anti-Putin, but anti-Russian, broad spectrum, which is an absurd position for a bunch of Russians to take in my opinion."
335,"Wow! I love you guys. He is really great. I love everyone.
TN"
336,This guy cant be serious comparing a rape with war
337,What a gift! I've recently thought that no one haven't been made any interview with this brilliant mind.
338,"I wonder how many other people got to Kotkin‚Äôs ‚ÄòResponse to Oliver Stone‚Äô, switched off and viewed all his arguments to that point with scepticism. What a mad false equivalence! I thought Lex dealt with it really well though‚Ä¶"
339,Fantastic interview despite the backdrop & heart break of tragedy of War.
340,I'd like to ask your guest how he would feel about Russia putting missiles on Cuba.  It's the same as Russia feels about the defacto natoization of Ukraine.
341,Brilliant interview Lex. Highlighting historic moments with some great questions. Brilliant alternative view from Stephen Kotkin compared with your very recent interview with Oliver Stone on the situation in Ukraine. Loved Kotkin's analysis of the economic reasons and strategies involved in war. My counter argument to his point about Putin's objection to NATO on his doorstep in Ukraine is simple. Remember the Cuban missile crisis. I also noticed that the Donbass region and what has happened there since 2014 was not mentioned. Could not help feel that Stephen would make a great propagandist for the West. He certainly paints a criminal manic picture of Putin. I found his breakdown of what the West really is intriguing and the fact that is really a set of institutions. Will watch again when I have a few hours to spare. Love your work and I only came across it yesterday. Stay safe in your travels.
342,"Kotkin contradicted himself several times... His arguments are cringe. Comparing NATO to a rapist.... : / 
and his condescending tone /hardpass for me after 1.5 hours"
343,"I agree with this gentleman on many points and disagree with him on many more points. I specifically disagree with how he kept equating all acts of right and wrong to their value on a global front, though he made some good points on other topics. What I cannot stand though is how confrontational and condescending he comes off in making some of his points, specifically his use of attitude smothered rhetorical questions. I‚Äôm sure given the accent, he‚Äôd say it‚Äôs just the way he talks or ‚Äúit‚Äôs an east coast thing‚Äù but that approach just makes a person sound ignorant and hot headed."
344,You say Putin can‚Äôt be compared to Stalin then go ahead and do just that.
345,One of the best podcast episodes I‚Äôve ever heard. Stephen is incredibly knowledgeable and exceptionally articulate. Amazing insights and perfectly said.
346,"I love Lex's interviews and podcasts. But I couldn't and didn't even want to listen to the end of this interview. It seems that Mr. Kotkin is just a naive person, or lives in another parallel dimension, or is frankly biased, and is not able to look at events from above in order to get a complete picture of what is happening.

When he said Lex's name so many times, it sounded arrogant."
347,The disruption of the oil industry is causing the prices of gas and oil to skyrocket.  This in turn is rapidly advancing the transition to clean energy.  It might happen so quickly that it results in a worldwide depression.  In the end we may have clean air with reduced CO2.  Would this happen fast enough without this war? Is it possible this is the only way civilization can be saved?
348,Exemplar of how delusional academics can be.
349,"The beggining of the end for Napoleon, considered one of histories greatest military strategist, started when he tried to invade Russia just like Hitler a couple of decades later. Napoleon's own account was: ""The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible."""
350,Let‚Äôs talk about building back better Let‚Äôs look in which way the WEF is involved  in this war  This war is a camouflage of their strategy
351,"""Whatever happens. I am truly grateful for every day I am alive. And I hope to spend each such day, adding a bit of love to the world."".

352,"Watching the interviews with Oliver Stone and now with Stephen Kotkin, both admirably well-conducted conversations, but also adding unspoken things, it still remains for the audience to listen their knowledge, their heart and their own experience to choose a side."
353,Vladimir is doing God's work in Ukraine
354,Thank you
355,I‚Äôm impressed at how cool Alex remained after 00:26:00 when Stephen starts laying into him for daring to suggest that the Cold War wasn‚Äôt as simple as goodies and baddies. I found this guy‚Äôs tone quite supercilious and condescending
356,"I hope war will stop. My fear is because nobody works on any kind of solution to calm the conflict, its too much hate out there."
357,"You‚Äôve come a long way as a great interviewer. The questions are thoughtful, and open ended just enough to allow your guests to speak openly and freely. This intro was a tough one, and I hope your travels provide exactly what you‚Äôre looking for. May the wind be always at your back, May the sun shine warm upon your face, and the rains fall soft upon your fields. Side note: the quotes at the end always hit me right in the gut (good stuff)."
358,His guy is a concise antidote to Oliver stone
359,I've been waiting sooo long for another  professor Kotkin video! The man is simply the best and most knowledgeable about Russia's internal dynamics
360,"Boy, it was hard to listen to this, and I say this as somebody that's watched almost every video of Kotkin out there. I knew he was a neocon, but he could be insightful at times; I had no idea he was this misinformed and delusional."
361,Lots of inference  and imputation  in Kotkin's arguments.  He also speaks as if every point he makes is true - and Lex just isn't armed with any facts in response.
362,2:21:54 like the West doesn‚Äôt have bromances where they tell the world what it‚Äôs going to be like like with the Fed and the interest rates you were talking about
363,"He lost me when he said countries are allowed to join any alliance.   US will never allow any country in the Americas to join any non-friendly military alliance.  At minimum non-friendly countries are already blockaded or sanctioned.  Worse, its leaders replaced."
364,"If that is one of the best historians, I am scared to hear average ones."
365,"Hi Lex, first of all, thank you for all your work. It is a high quality content that you provide, I appriciate that. I was listening to your recent interviews with Oliver Stone and Stephen Kotkin. They both have very deep and interesting views of the world to share and I enjoyed listening to both of them. Then an idea came to me, that it would be very interesting, at least for me, to see a discution between theese two bright men, which you could moderate. I just wanted to share this thaught, maybe you also would find it interesting :)"
366,An utterly fantastic interview!! What a privilege to be able to watch this. Thank you both. Ô∏èÔ∏è
367,"Minions, regimes, delusions are a few words banded about here by Kotkin without push back from Lex. somewhere between Kotkin and Stone lies the truth. And the truth shall set you free."
368,"""22 –∏—é–Ω—è —Ä–æ–≤–Ω–æ –≤ 4 —á–∞—Å–∞"" nearly without accent! "
369,"Good interview. What would bring more taste is to challenge your guests way more, but to let them still speak out and treat them with respect (what you do anyway)
Good journalism is about challenging the mindset and asking questions which will make you think rather than sitting there and having a chilled talk about your expertise. Else the risk is high to drift into one direction, which happened in this and the Oliver stone interview. I mean I appreciated both, however there was no challenging questions to stress your guests intellectually.
Respecting your guests is one thing but not asking challenging questions is dangerous"

372,Watch starting at 43:53 to see Kotkin shred the ‚Äúit‚Äôs NATO‚Äôs aggression‚Äù argument. Thank you Stephen for a well needed truth telling.
373,"Thanks Lex, This conversation was the most interesting I have listened to so far. Very informative. I listened the whole time. Codkin hits it on the nail."
374,This man is delusional! Hatred has blinded him.
375,Phew! Normal service has been resumed. Thanks for interviewing someone as knowledgeable and inciteful as Stephen Kotkin so quickly after your interview with Putin apologist Oliver Stone.
376,a fascinating 2 1/2 hrs. tkssss
377,"I Love you Lex, I legitimately worry about your travels, as you know the World can be cruel, please just be careful and always plan for the unexpected."
378,"This guy was born in Ukraine. Anyone expected objectivity from him? :)) If he really wants to study wars and human history, I think it would be great for him to study the rest of world leaders (which caused way more wars in history than Russians or Soviets), so he can open up a little bit more his mind."
379,"Amazing episode, I'm crossing my fingers and hoping you get to talk to Garry Kasparov again given the current situation"
380,I thought this was going to be insightful until I firstly noticed how many times he called Lex Lex!!!! A very manipulative tactic and hugely annoying....he should've been asked what he thought of Lloyd J Austin's remarks about debilitating Russia's Army
381,"on this hellhole of a platform, full of clickbait and bad takes, It sure is refreshing to hear someone fully articulate a complex argument in a deep, respectful discussion."
382,"Getting real ""Fauchi bullshit"" vibes from this guy"
383,"I'm from Ukraine, and I want to say its great true analysis by this gentleman. I saw a few clips with Oliver Stone and its a big contrast between two experts opinion. And not in favor of the Mr. Oliver, to put it mildly..."
384,Wow what a treat!

387,"If democracy is what we have in the west today, then I fully support Putin's dictatorship. I'll hand the chechen orcs some flowers when they reach Lisbon."
388,Problem with historians is that they cant analyse current  events
389,"Problem with all historians is that they hide their bias behind historical events and construct their own narrative that they believe to be true.

The rape analogy was very poor..."
390,"He sure likes the name ""Lex"""
391,"Perfect timing, thank you Lex!"
392,"This esteemed professor-historian speaks extremely nicely, seemingly rationally, and it is clear to me why the West dislikes Putin, but I have a feeling that this gentleman will soon have to change his democratic thinking. As far as I know, the Russians led by Stalin gave 27M of lifes in WW2 so that the West could enjoy democracy. Of course, everyone forgot about it except the Russians. Putin is here to refresh the memory of this dear respected historian."
393,This guy sounds like a campy movie lawyer for the west literally my cousin Vinny level of intellect and the same voice but defending the west vs Russia.
394,1:13:19 THANK YOU~!!

396,Thanks!

398,"Reasoning and analysis by Stephen Kotkin , are not based on obvious and true facts."
399,Thank you for the Guest and the Topics. Simple and clear! 
400,"History is made of heroes, villains, and bystanders. Bystanders make up the majority of the population, as heroes and villains make up small portions. The heroes are always few, as deception & ignorance influence the bystander. Given this consistency, I find it prudent to analyze any given situation, especially ones provided through the institutions who warrant no credibility, being the mainstream media, our own Government. The mere mention of a posed fact is reason to suspect otherwise.
I‚Äôll be the first to say, this guys full of it."
401,"I wish you good luck and a safe, successful trip! "
402,Thanks!
403,"I like Kotkin but I really hope that Ukrainian government is not like a TV production, than the truth becomes relative. We already had simmilar in 40s. About Putin he is 100% right."
404,"Lex, you should talk to Yury Dud. I‚Äôm begging you!"
405,"I seldom clicked so fast... Love the conversation, as well as your profound and poignant opening remarks. Take care and stay safe!"
406,"Hey Ukraine has had three revolutions in 30 years, the Granite, the Orange, and the Euromaidan in 2014. Indeed the Euromaidan triggered a full blown youth and arts renaissance, some of which expanded to banking and the military. The mere fact Ukraine is rated the second most corrupt country is eclipsed by its valiant struggle for and notable growth toward democracy. Moreover, this is the ninth ‚Äúmass murder event‚Äù‚ÄîtheRussian Civil War, the Holodomor, the Great Terror, the Nazis‚ÄîUkraine has suffered in 110 years. No wonder they don‚Äôt want to live under a murderous, conspiracy theorist-based dictator."
407,"""War is the natural state and heritage of evolving man; peace is the social yardstick measuring civilization‚Äôs advancement. Before the partial socialization of the advancing races man was exceedingly individualistic, extremely suspicious, and unbelievably quarrelsome. Violence is the law of nature, hostility the automatic reaction of the children of nature, while war is but these same activities carried on collectively. And wherever and whenever the fabric of civilization becomes stressed by the complications of society‚Äôs advancement, there is always an immediate and ruinous reversion to these early methods of violent adjustment of the irritations of human interassociations.""

408,2 hours of saying that America has no beef with Russia at all. The fact of calling everything Russia says as a cospiracy speaks books about how serious people Is trying to understand Putins choices
409,"The Spirit of Helsinki is dead, long live the Spirit of Budapest."
410,"I love Joe Pesci, he's so engaging. And he's a really funny guy."
411,"Prof. Kotkin's distinction between aggressive Russian nature and aggressive Russian policy is without a difference. A sociohistorical organism, like any other organism, is what it does.  Were the Russian sociohistorical organism not intrinsically imperialistic, it would not have had distinctly imperialistic policies of the last five hundred years, viz since the overthrowing of the Mongolian Yoke.  The formally oppressed predictably follow in the footsteps of the former oppressors. The subjugation of Siberia and Alaska to the East and Poland, Finland, and the Baltics to the West were mirror images, both in breadth and brutality, of the Mongolian subjugation of the two-thirds of Eurasia just three centuries earlier."

414,"Thank you for providing an interview with a leading recognized expert in the field on this subject matter to counter the imagined narrative of a Hollywood celebrity presented in the Stone interview.  This is the danger of social media and podcast.  Fans of celebrities tend to adopt the causal narratives provided by influencers that have little to zero formal education or first hand experience in the subject matter they discuss that thousands, sometimes millions consume"
415,"""Lex, Lex....      Lex, yeah Lex... You know Lex, Lex Lex, Lex... Right Lex, Left Lex, Lex Lex Lex, 





Lex.... "
416,"I‚Äôve watched a lot of Scott Ritter, Oliver Stone and others that hold views on Russia/Ukraine that run very much contrary to the overwhelming majority of mainstream newspapers/sites/channels (to include Fox News except for Tucker). And Ritter especially goes into extreme detail and brings receipts for most of what he says. Dude‚Äôs very convincing. 

I‚Äôd love to see all these people with different views put in the room with this (obviously intelligent and well educated) historian. I have a feeling he probably won‚Äôt ever do it, sadly due to the smears against anyone who has contrarian views, which tend to also put a stink on those who dare to interview or associate with them in any way. 

But I just want a truly open dialogue and debate of ideas. Because I feel like I‚Äôm being played yet again (i.e. WMD in Iraq, which led to the deaths of multiple friends and brother Marines of mine, and ultimately my being shot and paralyzed there). 

What can I say‚Ä¶ I have trust issues nowadays when it comes to my government, which never was the case for me until the past decade, due to multiple scandals from every administration and also learning about all the shadiness of pretty much every single administration of my lifetime (I‚Äôm 40 fwiw), as well as studying history in general concerning many in our government since it‚Äôs inception (certainly not all, but way too many)."
417,"Does Kotkin have any honest criticism of the West and the United States, and the behavior of the West towards the East over the past 100 years, or is he under the delusion that the US is a force for good against evil?"
418,Another guy who articulates very well that he doesn't want to understand what 's moving on with Tio Samuel....
419,"–ê MASTERCLASS in sense making, logic, reasoning and clear headed perspective! Thank you Stephen!"
420,STEPHEN KOTKIN IS A Historian who specializes in SATIN in Eastern Europe. An expert in extra thick books.
421,I like that you have brought light to both sides of the Ukraine war by interviewing Oliver Stone and Joe Pece...I think Oliver is more convincing.
422,Thanks!
423,"Sure, the head of Russian secret service ""imagines"" the NATO spreading their influence towards Russian borders, interfering in their elections and launching coloured revolutions in the neighbouring countries. We must've all imagined that."
424,Is it me or does anybody else think he sounds just like Hyman Roth
425,I appreciate you following Stone with this gem!
426,"I know this is an obvious comment, but the most important person that could listen to this conversation would be Putin himself. I like the way Stephen is able to be self-deprecating about the West end about Russia."
427,"I agree with Kotkin on Ukraine and Putin. I'd like to see him in an interview focused on the foibles of the West, really hear his ""favorites"", and how he responds to others, like the coerced extension of private property across borders etc etc, not to mention Vietnam, Indonesia and our countless killers in Latin America. And lastly our devastating effect on the planet via free markets. Oh and Trump, who shows our power may be in Putin-like hands all too soon."
428,This guy is great...to bad he is to smart to be in government..!
429,"Saying that Navalny is someone important in Russia is a bit exaggerated, he's certainly not the one who represents the Russian spirit in any form that is possible. Navalny is only important for the western press, and some deluted Russians who think the west is something great.
To make a synthetic, no Russia definitely don't inspire to what you think it does (to be as great as Europe), and that bias is mainly build around the Idea that Putin is the center of everything, while Russia can be as it is without any Putin, he's just a correct voice. This is a very low level of reductionist arrogant stance made by the west. The world can definitely live without the western idea, and probably it could produce a better outcome for the world."
430,1:06:40   'pick up the gun' - bill hicks
431,Just discovered this podcast. It's great and shows different perspectives on current geo politics. The used metaphor by Stephen though was not the best part of this interview.
432,This dude is a huge western imperialism apologist and has a child's cartoon vision of the world split into good guys and bad guys.
433,"I was disappointed with Mr. Kotkin by his lack of analysis of the new Russia society led by Putin since he became the president of the Russian Federation in 2000. In this PBS Frontline documentary produced in 2017, Inside Putin's Russia, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AkAZIk73F0 there are many analysis about the changes in Russia's society, especially in the religion aspects which could be one of important factors that led Putin to start the invasion to Ukraine in this February."
434,"Alexander Navalny as the second most important man in  the whole Rusia? How pathetic... It is just wishful thinking. No, Ste[hen is not expert at all. Lex, I respect your hard work, but this man is ridiculous."
435,"The four wars that Kissinger was referring to the American forces were fighting in a country where the citizens were willing to resist. It's the same position that Russia is in with Ukraine. Kissinger's big diplomacy coup was the Paris Peace Accords during the Vietnam War. Not much of a diplomat, the Accords were violated almost immediately. An interesting fact - On average Russia is losing almost twice as many troops per day as the U.S. lost per week in Vietnam."
436,"NATO doesn't attack? Yea, too bad that I'm still remembering the bombing of Serbia."
437,"I'd like to know why he thinks that Russia aspires to be ""stronger than the West""."
438,Statistics are flawed. Zelensky had 14.5M Votes out of 40M registered voters.  More people have left Ukraine. than who voted for him.  Yushchenko has 52% in 2005 in 2010 less than 4%.
439,"Thanks Mr. Fridman for this extraordinary interview! Your guest, Mr. Kotkin, is world class"
440,He's seems like a super smart dude but he also seems to have sarcastic-douchey connotations.
441,"Kind of lost me with the rape analogy! I don't want to seem cynical but no country anywhere has ever conducted foreign policy on such a naive and simplistic mode (least of all the United States when anything serious is at stake) because the issues are invariably complex and multi-faceted. As Richard Feynman once remarked (I paraphrase), 'to simplify the complex is to misrepresent it.' Foreign relations are in the realm of policy and law, where you are almost never faced with choices between good and bad, but are at best striving for the least worst across multiple domains (for which there cannot be a 'right' answer because you are making value judgements)."
442,1st interview Lex has had that I couldnt finish. Felt like a propaganda piece. (Not by Lex for clarity)
443,"On the point that NATO expansion to Russia border doesn't threaten Russia. In 1960s, USSR put missiles in Cuba. Why did the US feel so threatened? Why are Australians (and the US) so angry that China has signed a security pact with Solomon Islands?"
444,Lex desperate for that DARPA money with this one
445,Thank you for one of the best interviews on the subject.
446,I would love to see him debate Oliver Stone. And when you are talking about rape you should read what did the West do to Macedonia.
447,God bless President Putin and Mother RUSSIA for fighting against AngloAmerican criminal imperializm! ZZZ all day!
448,54:30 - 55:55 WOW
449,"It's interesting to see how biased this ""historian"" is against Russia. He's no doubt a defender and apologist of US imperialism's crimes, genocides, violation of human rights, etc, around the world in collusion with its vassal countries and NATO. Just watch how he conveniently leave out all of this Imperialist history, its doctrines etc, something many of the establishment experts. He certainly lives inside his academic bubble totally away from geopolitical facts, history and reality. What's even more interesting is how Lex the interviewer doesn't even challenge him on his fallacies, a sign he doesn't even understand the true history of the US empire.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSjim1GVwjE"
450,"Serfdom? Boy, is this guy clueless! I wouldn't know where to start ..."
451,Such complex history. Great podcast. Informative to the max.
452,"39:30
If you need to go back to the 1800s to justify NATO expansion then you know you're on the wrong side of history.  We can speak of manifest destiny, US-Mexican, 1812 etc if we're permitted to go back that far.  In fact, the US has more of a continuinity because they still have the same constitution (with the exception of a few amendments) as they did then, whereas Russia has been through many different systems/regimes."
453,"Okay, okay, okay I listened for the first hour and 7 minutes. I would like to remind the historian that with the international court of justice decision concerning Kosovo, the people of the Donbas and Crimea had a right recognized under international law to declare their independence and separate from the nation of Ukraine. Whether you like this or not this is the construct that was fabricated by the West in order to facilitate a portion of the breakup of Yugoslavia. Putin publicly stated this several months ago.
Also we cannot forget the Wolfowitz Doctrine which was leaked to the New York Times in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Which from all appearances seems to have been adopted as US policy. That Russia would be pushed back to its own borders and contained, isolating it from the rest of the world.
Yes this historian has a lot of knowledge, but I find it rather sad that he cherry-picks how he assembles this knowledge in order to create a narrative that justifies the actions of the West."
454,"take a slow cooking crockpot with steaming shyte and and stir for 2 hours add some sizzling bias and voil√°, Kotkin's Pie"
455,"36th minute is where our esteemed historian loses the plot.  The nonsense analogy of a woman being raped because of how she was dressed, the list of treaties that Russia was an inheritor of...  It's very puzzling how people who claim to be objective let their bias come right through.  When listing the agreements that Russia supposedly inherited after USSR, Dr. Kotkin completely ignores the 2 Minsk agreements that were sponsored by Germany and France, after which Ukraine comfortably did nothing and continued killing civilians in Donbass.  He conveniently forgets public promises given to Yeltsin by western leaders about non expansion of Nato to the East, that were blithely ignored.  He ignores public statements of western officials (prior to the war) that the whole ""Raison d'Etre"" for the Ukraine that was born in 2014 is weakening of Russia.  What you see happening on the battlefield now, where the west gives Ukraine old soviet junk to fight the russians with and encouraging to fight to the last ukrainian.  I won't even talk about the history of endless wars and invasions that US has with it's neighbors to the south.   Now, this was a democracy imposing itself on Grenada, Cuba, Nicaragua, Panama...  Again -- totally fascinating that the democratic peace-loving America is allowed to practice the Monroe doctrine while Russia is somehow bound to be held by order that was imposed on it by the west.   No credibility from the guest.  None whatsoever."
456,RUSSIA ABD CHINA HAVE THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE THEIR OWN CURRENCY
457,"Thank you for this interview Lex. I think it was very important for some of your audience to hear this perspective. If at its very heart a person cares about the value of Justice at all, like if you actually believe it is a real thing, then there is no other option than to oppose Putin's war of aggression against their neighbor."
458,Ukrainians are heroes!
459,The last episode of his was my favourite. Can‚Äôt wait to watch this one attentively.
460,I love this man and his intellect - but cannot help think he is straight out of goodfellas with the joe Pesci accent... Putin is gonna disappear I‚Äôm sure.....
461,"Kotkin talks about how Russia signed all these agreements that nations have a right to choose their alliances but makes no mentions how the US doesn't tolerate the same? And thats just 1 instance of many that he made that really doesn't make much sense.

Too bad the host never challenged him on what he was saying."
462,Best one yet.
463,Fun fact about the international criminal court in The Hague that the guest mentions multiple times: the US has let known years ago that it would invade the Netherlands if the criminal court would ever prosecute US citizens.
464,This ep makes up for that garbage Oliver stone was spewing
465,"I just Re-listened to this ‚Äúsubstantial‚Äù podcast __  again, thank you for offering alternative perspectives on this topic ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a huge contribution Lex ‚Ä¶ Ô∏è"
466,"Kotkin sounds like a mild mannered, well spoken Joe Pesci."
467,"The proposed agreement with NATO drafted by the Russian Federation Dec-21 
Art 5: ""The Parties shall not deploy intermediate and short range missiles in area allowing them to reach the territory of other Parties"". This would have meant permanent peace in Europe. Why was it not snapped up? 
Do we always have to treat the Russian Federation as a criminal joke!"
468,the example of a woman being raped is very poor as a comparison for explaining the Russian strike on Ukraine.
469,"Oliver Stone's analysis is based on the observation of how the world is, whereas Kotkin's judgement stems from a philosophy about how the world should be. The example of the raped woman shows that clearly. Yes, no one should go around raping women, independently of how they dress. However, women have to be rather obtuse to go around seductively dressed to a neiborghood of rapists.
Yes, we can agree on the moral imperatives about not abussing women or invading sovereign countries, but we live in a international system based on the condition of balance of power, that is, a neighborhood of rapits. Hence, despite your moral values, you gotta act according to the actual circumstances. That is, women should not dress provocatively if they live in a rapists neighborhood, nor NATO should have expanded to the very Russian border. That was stupid."
470,16 mins down I know it‚Äôs American propaganda
471,This is the best podcast I've ever heard. He's so damn good.
472,The Ukrainian parliament today has been purged of all dissent and a large number of opposing parties.
473,"Thanks for the interview. But this second one is simply impossible to listen to, it distorts the facts just terribly. Take at least about the fact that journalists are not killed in Ukraine - but what about Oles Buzina? And so on and so on, completely superficial judgments contradicting the facts. Either he has a poor command of the topic or he is deliberately misleading."
474,"Good interview, guest"
475,"A lot of what Plotkin said fan be applied to average working Americans, obviously nowhere near the extent of Russia but he asks ""Why not invest in your citizens,.Russia?"" The U.S. will greenlight literal trillions for wars & recently sending $50 billion overnight to Ukraine but would never consider putting that money towards infrastructure, healthcare, education, homelessness, etc. We also live in a oligarchy/corptocracy with an illusion of choice."
476,God be with you
477,Brilliant.  Possibly the most important podcast of a description of reality today.  
478,"Sorry about my previous comment. I was not level headed. This Podcast is very important, thanks to Lex"
479,"Good timing. I'm working on his Stalin bio, volume 2. Finished first one couple months ago."
480,"Not sure I really agree with the skirt and rape analogy. I think its more similar to the bloods and crips analogy. If you are a member of the bloods gang, and wear red clothing into a blue crips territory, you are likely to get shot. Now of course, it is the shooters fault for pulling the trigger intending to murder, but you should have well known not to go into that territory wearing those colors. 

Ukraine knew what they were doing when they intermingled with the corruption of the west, and the Maidon Coup. Yes, you can blame russia for pulling the trigger, but it isn't always black and white. Ukraine knew the consequences and proceeded anyway."
481,"This episode was one of the most whitewashed propaganda interviews I have ever heard.
When listening to the previous podcast with Oliver Stone there were quite a few moments where I had to roll my eyes, shake my head and laugh out loud, but this podcast takes the cake.
Whilst his knowledge of the overall history is undeniable, he ignores the clearly oligarchical quest of American aggressive foreign policy by arming, funding and training terrorists throughout the world. Plunging South America (not to mention the SE Asia and the Middle East, with Albrights proudly stating that the deaths of over half a million children in Iraq as ‚Äúworth it‚Äù) into chaos, barbarism, constant regime change, colour revolutions, proxy wars, covert aggression and all out war to maintain their apparent status quo.
It is no secret that the ultimate mission is to fuel the unquenchable thirst for plundering resources as well as appeasing the military industrial complex and deranged power brokers.
Furthermore pushing money sucking locust companies abroad to spread their global interests via rampant corruption and greed.
The division and control spread throughout Eurasia is undeniable, as evidenced in any of the books by the war hawk Brzezinski, who clearly laid out plans  many years ago on how to push their global power and never let other nations rise for fear of loosing their hegemonic empire.
Comparing the war in Ukraine to a woman in a short skirt really put the cherry on top of the blatant historical revisionist cake.
The  glossing over of the rapid and aggressive NATO expansion, the coup d‚Äô√©tat in 2014, famously funded and supported  by Nuland and her cronies in installing their American puppet, ignoring the conflict in the eastern break away states that killed over 14,000 people and the buildup of Ukrainian troops on the border to Donetsk. 
You have to squint to the point of blindness not to see that America is using Nato to funnel Americas proxy war. The flat out refusal for meaningful peace talks etc, just fans the flames of war and hatred, leading to the already apparent ethnonationalism, evidenced by the new pursuit of claiming Ukrainians are Indo-aryans.
I certainly don‚Äôt think Russia should have invaded and acted the way they did, nor do I downplay or ignore the great suffering caused in the name of the Soviet Union, especially under Stalin (or as the USA called him in WW2 ‚ÄúGood old uncle Joe‚Äù). 
However to make the ridiculous ‚ÄúMight makes right‚Äù arguments and stating that everyone else should just shut up and bow down to the almighty suits in Washington, not only to the worlds detriment, but also to the American people themselves, is as backwards as it is delusional.
At best many of Mr. Kotkins specific political remarks were laughable word salad, or worse, blatant lies and suppression to justify the continued bullying behaviour of American foreign policy.
The points Kotkin makes often seem like they came right out of a pamphlet from the infamous Atlantic Bridge, FDD or American Enterprise Institute etc. 
The world is too populated and large for there to be a single world superpower that dominates all.
If you want to understand your enemy and have any hopes of securing future peace, then one needs to be honest about the numerous downfalls and mistakes from all parties.
How Mr. Fridman managed to keep a calm demeanour and not burst out laughing at the delusional arguments made by Mr. Kotkin is a testament to his self control and intestinal fortitude."
482,Can you get Timothy Snyder?
483,Surprised that Putin‚Äôs popularity rating was never discussed. What does it mean for a dictator to have high approval ratings? Does that affect our view of his legitimacy?
484,Zalensky was a coup. Right??
485,"Thank you, Lex.  Impressive guest with an encyclopedic understanding of Russia.  Mike drop!"
486,Can listen to a good Historian all day. Very little surprises them because they study Predictable Monkeys all day
487,Goodbless lex it‚Äôs so sad to see that you are becoming literally a pawn between these two country‚Äôs you really love brotha. I hope you can get to see both of your country‚Äôs you truely love considering the fact your supposedly going against both in their eyes and it‚Äôs so sad your becoming a man without a country because you are reporting the truth without bias. Who would of thought you would get almost exiled from your country in the 21st century for reporting the truth so so crazy. god bless you lex hope you travel and come right back
488,14:35 Nikolai Patrushev looks like evil Stephen Kotkin :)
489,Mr Kotkin has always been careful what he said to be compatible with his job. You have to take it with a pinch of salt. I would call his message semi-propaganda. Always make the US look positive...not a bit a true criticism.
490,All these people citing international law as thought it is all of a sudden relevant.
491,"This introduction is just heartbreaking!Being half-Ukrainian and half-Russian myself, I can understand how incredibly hard it is for you, Lex. Thank you for another great episode! Please be safe during the trip you mentioned"
492,'Attorney Reiner Fuellmich gave his opening statements to the Grand Jury Proceeding by the People‚Äôs Court of Public Opinion.  Fuelmich has a group of international attorneys conducting a criminal investigation modeled after Grand Jury Proceedings to prove crimes against humanity throughout the C-19 pandemic.'
493,"As if integration into (private) Western global institutions is anything to aspire to, beyond the convenient ommision of a critical understanding of Western colonial Fascists and their projects clearly outlined in their OWN foreign policy documents.
Kotkin is a true believer in Western Liberal ideology and that's all there is to it. -Have fun with that."
494,"Very weak argumentation against Mearscheimer and Oliver Stone perspective at min 37.¬†

495,This is pure fantasy
496,"37:05 

... or the woman was secretly developing WMD"
497,!! .. two and a half hours of Stephen Kotkin.. The best..
498,"Kotkin is asked to respond to Oliver Stone's point (from a former podcast) that the US' hegemonial ambitions play a big part in the current war in Ukraine, and Kotkin goes on and on about the obvious fact that rape can never be blamed on the victim - WTF !?! If Kotkin is the great Historian he claims to be, why argue like a second rate hobby psychologist wasting our time with such simpleton arguments?"
499,"Lex: I think you should start interviewing leaders and people outside US and Europe, particularly from Asia, to get a balance and different perspective."
500,"10 minutes into the interview and it's obvious that he doesn't really understand the Russian way of seeing the world. He can talk and write all he wants, but still lacking the basic understanding, unfortunately."
501,"Chill out. Hated you for giving the platform to Stone, cause he was legitimately saying some nonsensical lies, but that was not enough to wish to ""go after you"". We have got so many more problems. Welcome to Ukraine. Stay safe, do not ignore Air Raid Alarms"

504,Thanks!
505,"huge huge thank you for your endeavours, Lex

I'd be happy to help

with love from Kyiv"
506,"Even though I agree more with what Stone has to say, Mr. Kotkin gets his points across in such a better matter. Awesome interview!!!"
507,"I think it's good to take a critical stance on Russia but I think American foreign policy is not great either, its important to acknowledge the mistakes the West has made in the middle East as well in South America"
508,I‚Äôm upset it took YouTube 6 days to recommend me this
509,"I'm pleasantly surprised Mr. Kotkin understands so exceptionally well all the intricacies, concerning my doomed country. Mesmerizing."
510,"we pushed nato to their borders. some there is truth in a little of what they say, I would never start a company there, they just take it"
511,Profound words from Kotkin. He never fails to enlighten.
512,"Lex -- you are a talented and patient interviewer...Mr. Kotkin (whose New York accent reminds me of the Borsch Belt comics) has quite a diatribe -- but his multiple studies and history tomes cannot hide the fact that he aligns himself with the Democratic agenda.  He does have potential to learn more about current, young society.   Perhaps he should listen to the Duran, a contemporary geopolitical podcast,  or speak with Russians that are toolmakers, die casters or concrete specialists.   Mr. Putin is maligned by university types and young, wealthy urban Russians.  Working people appreciate the peace and relatively comfortable affluence of these past years.   Mr. Kotkin lives by the grace of those seeking knowledge and have a few bucks (Princeton will lose a good portion of its endowment, unless they benefitted from weapons manufacture.)  And the West is no longer strong.  The days of a finance economy winning are gone.  Commodities will rule.  Russia, China and India are the big three....and this proxy war has lead the way."
513,"Lex, thanks for the great interview with Stephen Kotkin. He is an excellent analyst who is well versed in the subject area. As for Mr Stone, thank you for documenting all those lies, delusions, and victim-blaming rhetoric. And, please, tell Mr Stone that the traitor of Ukraine and Putin's crony, whom he so often recalled, is called Medvedchuk, not Medvedev. These are both awful but different people)"
514,Superb interview.
515,"First Oliver Stone then Stephen Kotkin, great views of the current situation. Both sides covered in depth and you are the best intervjuer, you let the guest speak from the heart."
516,"Kotkin is great. He needs to recognize how secular liberalism not as a political system but as a way of life is and for sometime has been corrupting in the West first.
Both natural law or the common good has been greatly undermined. The basic assumptions of a secular liberal West are politically atheistic and hedonistic.
We need to recognize that man can know the good and his nature. That we can achieve improvement by knowing our ends or goods rather than escaping from our nature.
So really liberal democracy needs philosophy and religion in order not to undermine itself.
This is the deeper issue not politics or international relations."
517,This has to be my favorite guest! What a great mind.
518,"Brilliant, crystal clear, moving !"
519,"""Build your enemy a golden bridge to retreat on"" - Sun Tzu
See Stephen paint this bridge effortlessly around 1:30:00"
520,maybe Putin's monologue of grievances explains his highly publicised meetings with government minions and annual public Q&A??
521,"Would like this guy to take a trip to Donetsk or Luhansk and see what the people there have to say. They have been completely ignored by the west, on purpose in the case of government and media. He should see what those people think of his opinion on the war."
522,"Next up, a war time general...?"
523,"Kotkin confuses me.  He speaks about Russia and the US foreign policies as consistent things over time.  They are not.  He does not consider that the US battles with corruption and inconsistency.   For a man who is seemingly very adept with language and has knowledge of many of the actors, his assessments sound like ""good guy, bad guy"" simplistic concepts."
524,"Kotkin: u think I'm funny, ha? Funny how, Lex?"
525,"Don't be afraid to go Ukraine. Wr Ukrainians, watch your channel long before the war. And we knew Mr stone before. And we totally understand why you did that interview. It's the same reason we watch Russian interviews, because we want to know their state of mind, from different perspectives. It is more correct to find out the truth or ay least come closer to it."
526,"Disappointingly one-dimensional interview. Kotkin‚Äôs views have been formed in 80s and 90s and colored by his work on Stalin which he‚Äôs applying to the current situation. Throughout the interview both Lex and Kotkin bent quotations and events ever so slightly to fit Kotkin‚Äôs narrative, starting with Putin‚Äôs end of USSR quote, with Kotkin‚Äôs misattributing cause of was with Georgia, Kotkin‚Äôs calling current Russian elective ‚Äúresentful‚Äù but using the word ‚Äúobizhennye‚Äù - completely bizarre to any Russian speaker due to well-known connotation to its usage, Kotkin‚Äôs willful neglect of serious regional differences in the Ukraine which ultimately caused the initial conflict. Kotkin‚Äôs is a very good propagandist, very knowledgeable, but propagandist nonetheless."
527,"I dislike the one-sidedness of this guy as much as the one of Oliver Stone. While Oliver Stone is just a silly romantic with little knowledge about duginist ideas, this guy just shines in the dark. Congratulations to Lex for bringing both sides on. However, it's time for someone like Michael Kofman to bring the equilibrium back. Kofman was one of the few analysts who had predicted this war since last year."
528,"I was just thinking Second Ave subway. Compare that to the Crimean bridge. One took 2 years and cost $3.5 B, the other cost $4.4 B and took ... 10 years? Guess which one is which."
529,"I am sad to hear that Lex is in the position where both sides of conflict condemn him because of being the medium through which the resonant opinions are expressed, what happened to ""don't shoot the messenger""? Huge respect to Lex. The politics of modern day are quite insane and people who are supposed to be our representatives have too much of their own interest involved in decision making process and less public opinion, seemingly, everyday"
530,How many times did he say ‚ÄúLex‚Äù?? Sounded a bit patronising
531,I'm thankful for mentioning my country Georgia (sakartvelo) . A lot of uneducated people still think that  we are part of Russia .
532,"I am so disappointed that as a Historian, he is so ignorant to his side‚Äôs issue. NATO bombed Serbia for months. It was a clear offensive war. In fact NATO will do whatever US really wants it to do, defensive or offensive. No US opponent believe for a second NATO is defensive only. That is the problem Stephen does not recognize. Hence his wrong conclusion of Russian worry of NATO expansion."
533,"The guest speaks of how Russia was not allowed to be included in with ""The West"" - the guest then details a bunch of reasons that made no sense - with no mention of how Russia was spurned by Great Britain & USA & every other county during all of the 1900's and for the last fifty years of the 1850's  --  spurned after Russia came in good faith asking for help before, during and after a multitude of events both domestically and due to invasions of their sovereign  borders -- 
The nationality of Russia did not begin with the emergence of Putin -"
534,"Hi, Lex your eyes are the same as of my father's who was half Ukrainian."
535,"Stephen Kotkin is definitely not a great historian. Obsessed with Stalin, he hates socialism and seeks to impart the idea that socialism is a misbegotten dystopia, a castle-in-the-air project. He is, in fact, a standard Western apologiser of capitalism, moreover capitalist propagandist, particularly of free-market politics (he was a prot√©g√©e of John P. Birkelund, late professor of History and International Studies at Princeton University and Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution, who was Chairman of the Wall Street investment firm Dillon, Read & Co. between 1986 and 1998; sat on more than a dozen Company Boards, including Barings Bank and the New York Stock Exchange, and was a trustee for a number of public organizations, notably the Frick Collection and the New York Public Library, to whom Kotkin dedicated his book Stalin: Paradoxes of Power, 1878‚Äì1928, calling him ""businessman, benefactor, fellow historian""). The whole thing about Kotkin is suspicious and and murky: obviously homosexual (try to find his spouse on the Internet), he is hiding his origins, but the surname Kotkin is Jewish from Belarus, hence his hatred of Russia, the October Revolution and socialism in general."
536,"Lex, do I see a bottle Fiji Water on the Table? Vinaka and greetings from Fiji."
537,"These are precisely the kind of calm, rational and insightful conversations that the world desperately needs to hear. None of the propaganda from the TV, simply people talking. Thank you for your work"
538,"This guy is brutal...clearly a good talker, and a smart guy, but obviously   suspends his objectivity for a cause...that Oliver Stone / rape analogy is damning evidence to this guy's true intent.. brutal"
539,"2:24:00 ‚ÄúThis is what I know, Lex, from studying history. Stuff happens.‚Äù Haha! And Lex‚Äôs laugh was priceless. The sentiment following will stick with me."
540,"Kotkin's books are translated in Russian and are available there in book stores.  
Nobody has been prosecuted for reading, translating and publishing them. Ô∏è

545,Kotkin and his nasally Long Island / New York drawl can put even the toughest among us to sleep. One of the best guests.
546,"The way he comparing Ukraine to Tibet, Xingjian and Hong Kong, not to mention Taiwan, make you doubt whether he is an ideologist or historian. Ukraine is an independent country, and all these other places are not. Basically he is saying West could not tolerate any country who does not live by West standard. What an imperialist view. that is root of today conflicts. He admires Ukrainian will of resistance, rightly so. But he does not understand Russian Will of Resistance to US is as strong as the Ukrainian Will against Russia."
547,Lex Fridman is a good interviewer with genuinely good intentions. This Stephen on the other hand I truly believe is a distorter of history and a lier.

550,Salute
551,A lucky find for me. Been waiting for Mr.Kotkin's view on the current developments for a while now.
552,I appreciate this comeback after the utter embarrassment that was the Stone interview.
553,"A lot of serbs migrated to Russia during Ottoman rule. After first Serb migrations around 15000 Serbs migrated into Russian empire and they created ‚ÄúNew Serbia"" and ‚ÄúSlaveno-Serbia‚Äù in regions of today's central and eastern Ukraine.

554,Someone was held accountable in the US for our criminal wars? Lol.
555,Lex and Stephen kotkin ! Wow intelligent and  Powerful! Polar opposite to Oliver Stone!  Thank you so much! Riveting! 
556,"20:43 a lot of people lost out? Not the Chosen Oligarchs who raided Russian resources and then fled to Isreal under Yeltsin!   This just proves my point on Jewish ancestral hatred toward Russia, even these two  gentlemen perpetuate"
557,Kotkin has been one of my all time favourite Lex episode. Love to see him here again!
558,I don‚Äôt like that our Lex is going to Ukraine or Russia. Lex is our treasure now. Lord keep him safe until he returns to us. PEACE
559,Kotkin is the detective with the flashlight who decides which set of bodies we should look at.
560,"You are doing a good job Lex.
But Mr Kotkin was using not proven facts and his comments all based on classical western propaganda. Hard to acknowledge that he is a Famous historian. Please found someone with more open mind, who can see a whole situation from angle of knowledgebased on analysisand logic. it will be a winner interview."
561,"If Stephen had been born in the Donbas in 2014 he might appreciate the Russian intervention.  The shelling, torture and killings take their toll."
562,Pride before the fall
563,Where Stephen's opinions contradict Oliver Stone's commentary I will side with Oliver Stone. For a long time I saw Russia as trying to participate in a positive global sphere of influence and distance themselves from the monster that the world must rally to defend against.  I've heard Vladimir highlight the importance of maintaining a relatively peaceful and stable power struggle internationally.  Of course if the west needs an ever present boogie man they may reject these ideals albeit to the folly of us all.
564,"lol Russia is fucking them up, where did you get this guy from?"
565,"I absolutely love Stephen, I feel he is the preeminent historian of Stalin, and of the communist revolution in general. Thanks again"
566,After Mr. Stone it's pleasure to listen somebody with brain inside of his head.
567,Thank you Lex for bringing this guy. You should invite him back and Stone together. Let them have a discussion and be the moderator. I would be curious how would Stone hold his ground when calmly but properly challenged.
568,Is anyone else anoyed by this guy calling Lex by name in every second sentence?
569,Kotkin is a fantastic man
570,"I would like to have chat with Mr. Lex Fridman! Now I will answer his last question what is the reason for our existence on this planet? The Answer: ""God created planet Earth and it was very beautiful, Water, birds, plants... But became very boring and The God put the Humans on the planet Earth  to watch the show and laughing on the stupidities what we are doing every day what other animals don't have that super abilities"" Basically we exist to entertain the God #&#"
571,Shot‚Äôs fired it‚Äôs over. Best interview. Who has the power. I am proud someone said it from my side of the world. Delusions are spreading.
572,"The guest sounds to me like a stenographer for the military-industrial complex.  Reality doesn't comport:  Russia's  kinzhal and other military capabilities are far beyond what we have; Ukrainian military were the first to start shelling Donbass;  Ossetia asked for aid in the war that Georgia had declared on it; and no evidence has been provided in the Navalny, Skripal or Litvinenko poisonings."
573,Kotkin is gold.
574,This dude is a fool if he takes everything at face value between American a d Russia
575,"Stephen's using of Rape example is very inappropriate. Every nation has deeply rooted security concern. Just like what US did to Cuba during the missile crisis, Russia is doing to Ukraine. Unless Stephen condemns US's behavior in Cuba crisis too, he is simply a hypocrite. And most of the world see it that way."
576,
577,"One of the most honest, reflected human beings in this world. Nothing but respect regarding Lex. Live and let live. Harald Norw Thing.."
578,"He seems like he has zero understanding of China. Diplomatically China has not supportive of the invasion, but has not sided with the Western sanctions, which basically always fail. Europe has not stopped trading with China. Claiming that Hong Kong, Xinjiang, or Tibet are like Ukraine is absurd as they have been consistently recognized as part of China in the modern era. Hawaii is more like Ukraine than those places are."

580,"Stephen Kotkin cannot fill the void left by Stephen Cohen, who passed away in 2019.  Cohen did not report views based on anti-Russian bias or favor; only on Russian history.   Kotkin, by contrast, reported Pres Putin's address in Munich as ""infamous"".   It was a strong expression of Russia's legitimate security concerns, but the infamy rests with the foreign policy of the US and NATO.    Kotkin is an entertaining speaker, but I avoid him."
581,"This guy seems like calm, relaxed & fit Joe Pesci."
582,that was some rough german
583,"This was a magnificent conversation, clarifying this current crisis for me that has not been made available anywhere else! This was useful for my understanding of the complex factors at play here. I take away a greater confidence in my understanding, without any of the media pandering and propaganda with all the current agendas being presented elsewhere!"
584,He sounds and looks very much like Joe pesci
585,"One truth certainly comes through in this interview, that ‚Äòempire‚Äô gets to write the history books."
586,"What a shame. When I saw your interview with Oliver Stone, I thought that you had a more objective and unbiased point of view. But after a few minutes of listening to your guest, and after looking him up and reading a bit about his opinions, I have to say that you have fallen out of the credible opinions on what is going on, and your guest is yet another apologist of the West without a shred of objectivity in terms of what the expansion of NATO and the blatant US militarism and aggression has done to many countries around the world. And now they got their wish: a war with Russia through a proxy, which is Ukraine."
587,He is obvious that he is not an ORGANIC thinker. He is a  western canonized mindset.
588,Hyman Roth from The Godfather part 2! That‚Äôs where i know this guy from!
589,"This was rather disappointing, knowing Stephens other work. I appreciate the effort, nonetheless!

We ignored the most towering fact of all: 
Russia has been invaded from west no less than THREE  times within 120 years by the LARGEST ARMIES IN HUMAN HISTORY
 
...and yet we (in or comfort and absence of threats like that) demand that Russia behaves rationally 
- mind you,  as NATO  approaches slowly but ""surely"" following broken diplomatic commitments from Reagan-era to Minsk 2014 - 
and so Russians now may wrestle with wonder in the prospect of a potential 4th invasion.  sigh

So who's being more paranoid and more pre-emptive? How you or I can even begin to imagine their perspective, let alone condemn it...is quite disturbing."
590,"only a fool would do business  in russia,(own one)"
591,Wish you had stone and Kotkin on the same episode
592,finally you have someone here on this topic who knows what he is talking about and has some sense.
593,I gave this guy an open-minded listen until he blithely buys into Russiagate as ‚Äúempirics‚Äù and keeps moving along without any more comment. That kindly signaled to me that I didn‚Äôt have to waste my time with the rest of the interview.
594,Be safe!
595,"This is the first Lex Fridman podcast I have listened to and it was outstanding. Great interviewee and great interviewer.
Looking forward to listening to other interviews done in the past and those to come in the future."
596,lol  is he on drugs?
597,"Great convo Lex thank you. I‚Äôve never heard such a persuasive imperialist, love the honesty - need more of that all over - calm honest discussion."
598,"Yes, the West sent a lot of money to Russia for altruistic reasons. I cant listen to this anymore. I thought Kotkin was a very good historian but now I have my doubts. If he thinks that the USA sent money only because they are ""good"" and didnt want anything in return, either he doesnt understand geopolitics or he thinks we all are stupid and he has an agenda. Can you be a good historian if you dont understand geopolitics? I think not."
599,"Excellent! I see Stephen's name, I hit watch. And you, Lex, are a great soul."
600,"Kotkin can qualify for a commander in chief of the western propaganda machine. Definitely, a very institutionalized man. Respect to Lex for picking such wicked opponents."
601,"Stephen Kotkin offers a truly eloquent argument of ""the length of her dress.""  I deliberately  listened to Kotkin (hoping to hear ways Mearsheimer and Stone are WRONG. I'd RATHER have beliefs that aren't dissident. But literally NO DETAIL supporting his beliefs that I can research in specific. 


So Putin annexed a region populated by Russians, which they had a base in for over 100 years -- which was ""seized"" without a SINGLE BULLET FIRED??  How'd our Ambassador know ""who'd be in power"" when there wasn't an ELECTION (& punctuate it with a ""fuck the EU"")? That sounds ""democratic"" to you..?  What an INTELLECTUALLY DISHONEST schmuck. He may speak 3 languages, but he hardly uttered a WORD that got SPECIFIC.  No mention of the DEATH SQUADS? KILLING DISSIDENTS IN UKRAINE ? Seriously, how's a US ambassador know WHEN THE RIOTS WOULD END??? -- unless WE WERE FUNDING IT!  

Tell me Stephen, was 2013-2014 compatible with Democracy? Yeah? Great; now tell me about the 1-6 conduct. was that an insurrection? Great; reconcile that sophistry for me. 

(what a MASTER CLASS in cognitive dissonance)
Both the ORANGE, MAIDONE, ROSE, REVOLUTIONS, were ALL CIA FUNDED.

602,55 mins 45 sec...la mentalit√© de n'importe quelle soldat professionnel...tout est une question de perspective...mais tout n'est pas une question de bon send
603,Kotkin has a heavy coping mechanism and a tunnel vision. So many things he said are half-truths and generalization.
604,is Lex gauching?
605,"Another excellent conversation. It caught me up on a number of things, and brought new realizations as well.  Further, as an American currently living in lockdown in Shanghai, I most appreciate the ""detour into China"" part of the conversation.  The end was a great wrap-up! I feel it!"
606,"A masterclass, a spellbinding analysis on what is going and what could happen in Ukraine and Russia. Stephen Kopkin is unique."
607,"I certainly think this talk is both a great show of intelligence and humanity. Kotkin is perfectly right , there is no such thing as 'innate Russian aggressiveness', it' s a strategic choice . Didn't like him that much when on this show about WW2 leaders  (Roosevelt, Stalin, Churchill) he suggested the western allies might have convinced Stalin to kill the Chinese  communists and thus prevent 'our contemporary China problem ' from developing ."

611,"Great work, you showed both sides"
612,Stephen is so set in his way that his bias spills out like soda pop shook up on the back of a wild bull.
613,"30:50 Stephen Kotkin's reference to the West's rule of law, protection of civil liberties, ""freedom is better than unfreedom"", etc, is surprisingly simple-minded given that virtually all of our internal discord is based on structural inequalities in freedoms related to wealth, opportunity, and civil rights. And his assertion that Patrushev and Putin believe the West is trying to destroy Russia is understandable considering the expansion of influence and control over Ukraine's natural resources via IMF structural reforms and NATO protections deliberately being advanced by the West. Kotkin offers plenty of historical induction to his conclusions but I much preferred Oliver Stone's deductive analysis and story-telling style. A well-balanced series IMO regardless of your legitimate travel fears."
614,"About Putin vs West:
Bad stuff happens everywhere, that is just the human condition. We can only try to learn from our mistakes and improve.

I mean, What is better? Freedom you understand or illusion of freedom?
Kotkin's whataboutism sparked a few questions: 
- What about gerrymandering traditions in american politics?
- ...two party system where one party breaks the US and other fixes, where are the alternatives? 
- ... Finnish ""advisory"" voting that manages to keep a political party in power for decades, while they do not need to keep any of the promises to the people? 
- ...education funds being progressively cut since end days of cold war 1?
- What about so many protests I've never heard of on national news. Unless it's protest against bad policy when there is a opportunity to blame the protesters?
- What about Political Transparency being one of the most wanted things in western world? 
Are you OK with that? 
and these are just from the top of my head... there are obviously more.

The more I listen to differing opinions the more I see west and east as the same coin, with a cloak on one side and dagger on the other...the less I want to live on this planet, where ""powers that be"" only want conflict because it seems that, that is the only state they understand how to rule, and if it works don't touch.

Sorry for a shameless Plug: #OccupyKuiperBelt!

About Response to Oliver Stone:
Firstly, Russia has had more women than men in population for a long while now, Raping is just not a part of the culture...yet that is what is used most often to demonize Russia nowadays. 
That said, I agree that Russia invading Ukraine, if it was purely on the basis of them trying to join NATO, was a bad move that Russia will pay for.
Was it right or wrong response to political shenanigans that was going on at the time, I'll probably never know. Was it right for the people who have died and will die because of it, hell no! 
 But NATO is not just a humble defense union of pacifist nations, it's also a defender of Capitalism. And currently capitalism is posing an existential threat to whole humanity in a form of global warming.
 As I see it, continuing this war and escalating is only in the interests of capitalists, especially those who specialize in war.

About Russian invasion of Ukraine:
Strangely, in this section there wasn't that much talk about the invasion.
 I was born in USSR, but I grew up in the west. What I've seen is same type of thievery in the west and east alike. The only difference that I can see is that in Russia people are just more aware of it because the thievery and oppression is done more openly. 

About  Putin's plan for the war:
If you look at history, Russia has always sucked at offence :D newest attempt does not look any different. The only way Russia ever expanded, with any significance, was without a bloody conflict. 
In a way, it looks like Russia is trying to be like a very specific Western country, and failing miserably at it. Because Russia is just not playing to their strengths.

Twitter is not an open world game where an indifferent party provides facilities for fair engagement, it's a game where one opponent makes all the rules with impunity. I.o.w. for Russia that was an unwinnable battle to begin with.

Interestingly, I have been thinking similarly that Putins invasion in Ukraine is not as simple of a thing as ""go kill ppl, because nazis live there too"". Imposing economical pressure on the West by means of a prolonged proxy war, could be one of his the actual goals...but it only works as long as West is using Ukraine as a proxy to test their new toys ...legally.

Why Ukraine? Well that just happens to be a country that cannot trigger a WW3 as soon as you attack em...
 In a way Finland could have been Ukraine just as well, as we have neo nazis here too, just like in America also in power positions(according to tabloids of the past). I'm guessing that ""denazification"" is one of the reasons why Finland decided about NATO membership so quickly :D but seriously, there are better ways to deal with misguided people than a war.
Attack started to the west, and Russia had only two choices there, after a quick googlin I found out that there is only few differences that matter between two countries, Finland mainly exports machinery and shitting paper, while Ukraine exports food in significant enough quantities. Attack on Finland would simply not have same effect on the West, because people can live without Finnish machinery and shitting paper, but not without food...

...hmmm this is starting to make sense. I'm thinking that Ukraine is just a well calculated political move. No stupid ideologies are needed, for anything but information warfare.

About the rest:

Thank you Lex for being thorough and bringing opposing opinions. Your conversations make me think."
615,Kotkin is probably not aware of Zbigniew B.(a few stirred up Muslims)And the RAND institute(extending Russia militarily) and George Fridman(US financed all rainbow revolutions along Russia‚Äòs border) and Daniele Ganser(Imperium USA).
616,"At 1:36  this is not a war,  it is an invasion."
617,Thank you Stephen Kotkin. Thank you Lex.
618,Russia was very careful to make sure their Special Operation is legal under international law. They're defending their alliance with the DPR and LNR
619,"Living close to military actions and hearing cluster bombing couple of times a day, I am actually really surprised that someone that far knows so well what is happening at this very moment."
620,"The terrible thing about poison, Lex,  is that there is 98-99% good food, Lex. 1% of it, Lex, is poison however, and that, Lex, makes the whole dish poison. Lex. 
Kotkins examples are lacking, though not all. 
Putting words into someone‚Äôs mouth doesn‚Äòt cut it, Stephen, doesn‚Äòt cut it, Lex."
621,"I wonder what Stephen would say if Russia were to have its nuclear missiles in Cuba, or Mexico hosting Chinese airbases, and troops."
622,excellent excellent excellent
623,Appalling bias and lack of any objectivity. Goebbels would have been proud.
624,"Question did the freedom help the American from stopping the war in Iraq!!! I think the worst they don‚Äôt care about human life the only thing they can care about is the control the world not to make it better place..One last thing, in the world we live in. There is no such thing as absolute freedom for everything. The reason is that we live in different cultures and religions"
625,Thank you! Stephen is brilliant as usual.
626,"I have to admit, in my ignorance at the bottom of the world here, I had never heard of Professor Kotkin before this terrible war. He is such a brilliant mind and speaker. I have enjoyed listening to him through this situation which has brought him to the public fore. Thank you Lex for such an interview."
627,"This guy is a neocon, I appreciate the historical perspectives he brings, but we can't forget that Oliver Stone actually sat down with Putin for a long time, I trust Oli more on it.  He's so wrong on Navalny and Nato etc...  Still good to hear differing opinions."
628,war is terrible...Thanks for the podcast
629,OMG this is the 1st person speaking which sounds logical and has heard speak with clarity.
630,Putin be like 
631,I've read both of his books on Stalin and the guy is top notch
632,He and Oliver are two extremes..
633,The problem with the heavy weapons we sent Ukraine is that we have only sent small amounts. A couple of hundred artillery pieces is a drop in the bucket. The same with rocket launchers. We need to send large amounts now to overwhelm the Russian army.
634,"Thanks Lex Fridman but not Stephen Kotkin, he only speaks the good about West."
635,"This guy forgot that Stalin paranoia was quiet correct, since as far as I recall was Germany, Italy, Hungary, Rumania and Finland who invaded them on 22nd June 1941"
636,"Mr Fridman would do well to read a bit of Chinese history during the dynasties.   If he does, he would learn that in an important regard China, today, is much like China during the early Ming dynasty, a trading dynasty.   It sent out its fleet as far away as Madagascar, but only for commerce.    It did not send soldiers to occupy other lands,  to seize ports, and steal commodities.  So with China today, and so different from Great Britain in the 19th century and the USA since the 20th century!   In the late Ming,  China turned inwards from external trade, much to its regret when it became a victim of the west.   Now,   China is a developed nation, but unlike the warlike British and Americans,  it still seeks only commerce and does not try to impose its will on others."
637,Excellent rhetoric for Lex to bring up the Oliver Stone interview.
638,This is why podcasts are so important‚Ä¶could you imagine Kotkin saying this at Princeton? Doubtful. Gloves came off here‚Ä¶
639,I can‚Äôt believe I got to listen to this for free. How lucky I am to bathe in this wisdom.
640,Excellent podcast - i very much enjoyed the listen. Thanks to Stephen and Lex.
641,"Great job Lex! Love your interview style and the way you get information like no other, imo."
642,May God bless you with traveling mercies. ICXC NIKA
643,"Wow! Superb interview. I don‚Äôt know whether to be overjoyed or terrified. We need better leaders in our country, pronto."
644,This guy is completely unreasonable lol
645,I been waiting on him to get back on here since the Ukraine WAR started. Highly recommend to check out the 5 questions interviews at the Hoover Institute.
646,"Excellent work, Lex thank you."
647,This was an amazing program thank you you deserve a compliment from this man
648,"Be free, travel."
649,Wow. I never heard of Stephen Kotkin before. Thanks Lex. You guys are great. Love you talk.
650,This guy's response to Oliver Stone is one of the stupidest I've ever heard.
651,"He's like Joe Pesci's intelligent brother, who 's ready stab Russia ten times."
652,"I'm so glad  I discovered this chanel, thank you Lex!"
653,All the best to you as you travel. Looking forward to seeing through your eyes as much of Russia and Ukraine as possible.
654,Mearsheimer has it all over this nonsense
655,Brilliant interview. Thank you so much.
656,"Mr. Kotkin, why are you hiding your birthplace? Were you born in the Soviet Union? Btw Russia is already winning the war in Ukraine and the USA is loosing its dollar system and its superpower status! You are an old cold war warrier and a man of the past. You have lost, too."
657,As an Ukrainian I approve of thus message
658,"Thank you for your work, Lex. -LWO"
659,I‚Äôve been scouring the net for Kotkin‚Äôs takes on the current situation.  Fuckin DELIGHTED to see him back here!
660,Thank you Stephen Kotkin! Thanks for the interview too!
661,Thank you for this Lex.
662,Putin Stalin u forgot Churchill
663,Thank you so much. Stephen has the ability to see from the past history with a perspective from all areas of the world
664,"@1:32 Screw that!!! It‚Äôs 2022, we got google earth bro"
665,I feel like I just listened to Joe Pesci explain the history of US/Russian relations and the current situation in Ukraine.
666,"lex, we may disagree on stuff but i deeply admire your ability to ask a question and then shut up let the other person speak for hours without interrupting

these interviews are a gold mine of insight and knowledge"
667,"Thank you, Lex. Incredible interview!"
668,I forgot. I stopped the video after the first 10 minutes.
669,You're incredible man! I really appreciate what you are doing. How you are doing this is exactly my kind of flavour so it's really amazing to find a podcast that vibes so well with how I enjoy these kinds of conversations. Keep up the fantastic work and stay well!
670,"Actually, the territory is smaller than the Tzarist Russia - historian?"
671,Thank you for your videos Lex
672,Random but I love how he calls Lex by his name every now and then it's so endearing
673,"@Lex Fridman Excellent guests. I don't know if he's still doing interviews, but Michael Parenti would be an excellent addition to this discussion. As independent and as knowledgeable about history as Steven."
674,Because you had conversation with both of them you should be safe in both countries
675,Lex Freedman... The most Russian dude Eva. Thankyou for all your work. Learning so much :) cheers.
676,"Dang lex, start me off with wet eyes"
677,It's great to hear Joe Pesci again!
678,Thanks for this interesting listen!
679,Joe Pesci sure knows a lot about history and geopolitics
680,"appreciate your work Lex !

now, did anyone count how many times Stephen said ""Lex"" ???"
681,Amazing conversation. Valuable. Pleasure
682,TALK IS EASY AND COMMENTS FROM THE SIDE LINE.
683,Amazing podcast and guest
684,"What price did Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz etc pay for their war of aggression against Iraq?"
685,Should talk about war and invasions instigated by the US sometime.
686,Wow could he make it any clearer. Really worth listening to twice. Priceless.
687,"When you're watching 'just another' episode of Lex show, and out of nowhere comes the Meaning of Life. 
An outstanding episode, though, in it's immediate relation to the current moment in all it's dynamics."
688,"Hi Lex, ever thought to invite Anand Giridharadas ?"
689,"Could you get some interviews of some regular people? Could we get a guy who's been Trucking his whole life? Somebody who works at a hospital? Maybe some Dock Workers? Or some sort of worker that runs into foreign workers organization? Like fishermen that run into Chinese . Actually a good one would be, someone who works on the shipping vessels that goes to the East China Sea, if we could hear first-hand about the Pirates and the insanity of the Chinese government. Maybe, someone who used to be a mayor or some sort of other local government official? And retired. Or maybe hear from some people from Middle America? Maybe hear from some sort of a migrant farmer or? It also be pretty cool to hear from an illegal resident that lives in Middle America. If we could hear why they went that route, and if they think there's any alternate for them, and I don't know. Would also be cool with it here other retired government organization workers. Like the IRS, EPA, Transportation organization, FDA, Etc, so we can get a sort of feel of how different presidents, indifferent legislation and events, affect the running of very important day-to-day operations organizations. Or people who used to work inside coal mines or electric plants. 
Maybe even see if you could get ahold of some Civil War, or other war re-enactors, or other things that just normal Americans do. Maybe some sort of champion vegetable grower, or better yet, just some regular farmers. If you could ask how they break even or make any profit, but ask what they think of Bill Gates, what they think of the price increase of oil, which increases fertilizer and cost. You could ask them how they feel they are represented in the mass media, ask them what they think of the big monopolies on farming, ask what they think about the future of farming, and if they feel they are well-represented or if they feel lobbyists for big corporations rule everything.. and what could be done to improve farming in America. Of course you know to continue to keep doing all these academically educated, and top of their field, interviews, but it would be really nice to hear from some normal people. It could be a sort of before 2024 look at regular Americans that aren't in coastal or high population States. Some of them are actually very intelligent themselves, they just put in that work physically, or locally, instead of being able to spend their time on more intellectual endeavors. I just think you would be able to handle these types of interviews very professionally, and be able to get to the important questions and answers.

Maybe also hear from sports and entertainment talent scouts, and casting people...maybe even modern writers..and reaction to modern trends of diversity.

I wanna hear what normal people think of all these serious current events(topics of this video,):and what they think about covid response and the ""woke"" stuff
...to hear what normal people think of how out of touch with their reality..the ""bubble,"" of the media and elite really are in their view. 

I am sure you would be able to find the gems of informed and intelligent people is that fit into those categories of being just very normal Americans, the types that feel sort of ignored, even though they still very important roles in society. Whenever the mainstream media interviews these people, it feels like they go out of their way in and make them seem dumb it is kind of annoying. I am sure you would be able to handle the topic much more respectfully, yet, also honestly

I'd also like to hear an episode with Robert Spalding, and laowhy86&serpentza.. the first was the American military attache in China for a few years..and 2nd two are two civilians who lived in China over 10 years
..witnessing the fall of China golden age into a xenophobic ethnostate hellhole firsthand. Where China went from hiding its actions...to just denying genocide"
690,Navalny has almost 0 influence what are you talking about
691,Still waiting on your interview with Putin.  Make it happen.  
692,"Gott sch√ºtze Sie und ihre grandiose Arbeit .Ô∏è
Passen sie gut auf sich auf lieber Lex.
Greetings from Germany Ô∏è"
693,"Lex, this interview, Lex, is a great interview. As you should know Lex‚Ä¶. Keep up the great work Lex."
694,"Hy Lex, do you really think you are so important by keeping your planned visits to Russia and Ukraine a secret? Please sober up from your fame as an excellent Interviewer and good luck with your everlasting quest for knowledge"
695,I very much like your channel and I did saw previous interviews with this guest which they impressed me. I have great respect and interest in what this man has to say. I dissagree on one point the most influential historian of all times and perhaps the greatest is Thucydides. I listen yo your podcasts because they are of high quality to my opinion. How did you make this mistake? In any case thanks for the great effort and the great work you are doing. I really like your podcasts and I want to see you alive well and happy.
696,"I really dont like the twisting of facts in this IV. Now Novichok....smth that's already been proven to have nothing to do with Russia. The Skripals, the Navalny....complete BS."
697,"Super interview, Stephen Kotkin is fascinating to listen to, much of what he says makes a lot of sense."
698,Such a humble guest 
699,"Generally speaking, upper levels of political power often resembles ‚ÄúThe Mob‚Äù way more than national statesmen."
700,"Thx for interviewing S. Kotkin, it gave me a more  detailed perspective of the actual western narrative on this war. It would be interesting to have some of the people you inteviewed all together in the same room exchanging / commenting on each other's viewpoints, a real debate on this issue which, as for the covid pandemics. it has largely been avoided in the main media with the resulting polarization of parts as well. 
I wonder whether Noam Chomsky could be willing to offer his take on the war on this channel one of these days.
These kind of conversations make me think that there is no ultimate or aboslute truth, that each part (such as Oliver Stone, Chomsky, Measheimer, as well as Kotkin, Putin, Zelensky, etc.) each have a part of the truth, and deep dialog between all parts is necessary to discern the whole truth.
I found Kotkin a bit paternalistic each time he addressed you by often starting his answers by ""you know Lex...."" . Since my native language is not English my perception of this way of relating may be a bit skewed however.
And ultimaltely the most important thing is humanity and love as you say! I enjoyed watching how you finished your interview  by showing your vulnerability...
Be careful when you go to Russia/Ukraine"
701,damn what a great talk. thanks as always
702,"If you have the balls,‚Ä¶interview Dr. Mathew Raphael Johnson."
703,I saw Stephen Kotkin on Charlie Rose and Hoover Institution's uncommon knowledge with Peter Robinson a couple of years ago and ever since I have aggressively listened and watched and read almost everything he has done. He is a genius. I STRONGLY suggest whoever reads this to watch those interviews on Youtube. Just simply some of the best recorded conversations ever had on planet earth.
704,"All microelectronics & important parts can be shiped from China. Neither Europe or USA produce thes, all production comes from China/Asia."
705,"Hey Lex, you are a cool person and despite the podcast with Stone you will surely be welcome in Ukraine. After all, everyone understands that you are, as a host of the podcast, trying to independently look at the issue from all sides :)"
706,The best most interesting pod cast guest
707,"38:00 man, for such an intelligent and well-spoken person, he makes a pretty bad and severly skewed comparison here"
708,Oh i think king leopold of belgium and Pol Pot could share a shelf with Stalin easily.
709,"This is a great lecture, Lex"
710,But isn't Russia's war a defensive war? Its alliance with the DPR and LPR was attacked by the Ukraine.
711,"One of the best podcasts iv'e heard. Stephen Kotkin with his knowledge and clear headed analysis. Lex as the playmaker, setting the atmosphere with his curiousity, warmth and open-mindedness. And just the relaxed tone in the whole conversation was enjoyable."
712,"das war das Beste Gespr√§ch die ich jeh geh√∂rt habe. Die Einsichten sind √ºberw√§ltigend. Meine gr√∂√üte Anerkennung. Danke. 
That was the best conversation I've ever heard. The insights are overwhelming. My greatest appreciation. Thanks"
713,Imagine if Putin was the ‚Äòleader‚Äô/controller of the west.
714,I love you too pal. 
715,Deffo one of my favorite interviews of yours so far
716,"This man is delusional, he should open the university window and take a look. Reality always prevail."
717,"Great information. Thank you! But Stephen Kotkin`s enthusiastic praise of Mr. Zelensky`s strategies reminds me of the making of the worst figures in history via  adoration, idealization, veneration. In other words:  less ""Hail"" and ""Praise"" of the newest Hero figure in politics  might be  a better choice!  They ALL  started as nice people and gifted leader-figures  who sacrificed themselves for the benefit of their people ..."
718,"I did listen 4 times. Simple clear explained. Good is good, evil is evil."
719,"I love Kotkin's biography of Stalin. I'm reading the second volume now and await the third eagerly. 

I have some questions though.

1. Why and how would there be a widescale insurgency in the eastern part of Ukraine, given that it's ninety percent ethnic Russian? I don't think the analogy with partisans in WW2 makes sense at all. I could be wrong.

2. I don't think the Russians ever intended to occupy Kiev. My understanding was they surrounded it, except to the west, to keep Ukrainian forces locked down and unavailable further east. Occupying a city of that size in the year 2022 would cost blood and bad optics, I don't see many modern armies wanting to do that. I could be wrong.

3. In terms of institutional and monetary pressure, I am surprised to see the Ruble at higher prices than what it was against many major currencies than before the war. I think Kotkin is correct on some of the tech transfers and blocking of exports in the mid-term causing issues with the Russian economy though. But it seems clear the Russians prepared to some degree for the immediate pressure they would feel. I could be wrong.

4. I have never even heard of the idea of a combined counter-attack by Ukrainian forces in the summer. The idea somehow the heavy weaponry is going to make a huge difference that late in the game seems unlikely to me but maybe I'm wrong. It also assumes the bulk of it isn't destroyed in transit and that the Ukrainians have the training to use it.

5. Pretty sure you can't take out a tank with a Molotov cocktail.

I like Ukrainians. I like Russians. I have nothing against the people of either country. If smarter people than me read this, please let me know where I'm mistaken."
720,I feel so blessed to have seen this.
721,Lex you should interview Peter Zeihan. He‚Äôs a geopolitical analyst and great speaker that could add a lot on this issue.
722,Leaving out the western backed Ukrainian coup.
723,"But I cant abstain from widely smilig of your introduction solemn, even sobre tone, Dear!  @Lex Fridman"
724,This is interesting but Stephen is incredibly Western-centric and incredibly biased..!
725,Wow! The most moving and enlightening discussion between two human beings that I have had the privilege of attending. I am intellectually and emotionally affected by this exchange. Stephen Kotkin is an absolute brilliant man and thinker.
726,"Don't go to Ukraine. When you say it's dangerous because of conversation with Oliver Stone, but still intend to go, you're clearly underestimating potential risks."
727,"Fascinating to listen to someone with opposing views on, well, everything."
728,Wow ! Clear Headed..
729,"The biography of Stain. Born, beaten by his father, went to seminary, robbed banks, killed a lot of people, then died because people feared checking on him as he died. 

Hey Lex, good luck with travels. We never know if all the accusations about Russia and Ukraine are real or not."
730,M O I S T E Y E S
731,This is the best interview on YouTube.
732,This episode is amazing. I still don't get why people think it's a good argument to bring up US foreign politics. It's like saying: WHAT ABOUT AIDS when people talk about cancer..
733,Some of the most insightful and thought provoking conversation you will find.  This scares me more than I previously allowed. We should all be scared of what is being discussed.  God help us
734,Biden 2024
735,Can't really put my finger on it but this guy seems to draw the final wrong conclusions after all this intense information-gathering I think Lex is being a great listener but it was embarrassing to hear this guy twist things around I wouldn't have them on again just as a protest against ignorance
736,
737,"you know what lex, I really enjoyed this conversation. Big contrast to your conversation with Oliver Stone. 

As much as I like him as a director, I was really surprised by the arguments he made (not all of them were wrong but most of them were at least way to simplified)."
738,Great interview!!! With real specialist!!!
739,Better guests than Rogan these days.
740,I‚Äôm a third of the way through this - Lex is coming off as a very naive schoolboy. I feel like I‚Äôve watching a yoga instructor discovering/not discovering realpolitik.
741,"Lex, i'm excited for you to go back. i just went back to Novosibirsk where i was born for the first time in 21 years.. So much change. My brain exploded, still haven't put it all back yet"
742,"""We font have to stand up to the West?""- that is mental to even suggest that. Which means follow the fate of Iraq and Libya????Ehhhh...Thanks....but...no....thanks"
743,"It's not convenient to have an enemy, it was and still is by design"
744,"Should have wayyyyyy more views, but if you think about it this video would be blocked from China and Russia ;)"
745,Voluntary sphere of influence and Navalny the second most important person in Russia  I'm saving this for future ridicule. No wonder USA policies are a failure.
746,Highly informative. Nice one guys 
747,Interesting podcast thanks Lex keep up the good work Ô∏è üá∫üá¶
748,The analogy with the raped woman seems seriously flawed.
749,Momentus space is a prime example of talented leaving Russia
750,Interesting.  I It's good to hear different sides.
751,"Stefhen is spot on the reality of this tragedy. Its a just description of the situation, actually a overtly one. Lex govern the dialog in a open and.pro way. Great session Lex."
752,"I was hoping  some more balanced, less tainted cold war points, which  always is  more interesting to hear."
753,"Could you get some interviews of some regular people? Could we get a guy who's been Trucking his whole life? Somebody who works at a hospital? Maybe some Dock Workers? Or some sort of worker that runs into foreign workers organization? Like fishermen that run into Chinese .

754,"""There is no inherent tendency for Russia to be aggressive"" ??? any example from the last 1160 yrs, please!"
755,"Those with power, influence, wealth ,combined with an inherent disdain for the common man, no matter where they live, will set themselves above the rule of law, will commit any atrocity to further their own interests."
756,"If you know a little more than what Kotkin says here, he is a very disappointing person. Far too one sided. He sounded like a commentator for Western hegemony. Western countries/institutions give money only to control and dominate countries. Eg Bolivia>IMF>water infrastructure>provided by a Dick Cheney company that attempted to stoo all catchment of water, and impose the Bolivian population with a tax for water that would cost the average income earner 30% of the wages. Try researching paper written circa 1900s from colonial Britain stating need to control Eurasia. What about msnbc Mika Brzezinski's father, Jimmy Carter's National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski. He wanted the West to have control over Eurasia too. Simply put, Western control over China's and Russia's resources."
757,Hilarious! Amazing nonsense to the point of being delusional.
758,Fascinating and brilliant
759,"take a shot everytime Stephen says ""Lex"""
760,"Lex, you were good
Conversation with him was pretty intense especially when he was triggered by words ""Cold War"","" convenient"", ""freedom"" and spoke constantly you you you
I wished he did understand questions and give appropriate answer without aggression"
761,I love the way he speaks!!
762,"Sorry but his response to Oliver Stone with the comparison to the rape is laughable in the extreme. The two cases are completely alien to one another and comparing a criminal case to realpolitik in international law (and geopolitics) as a moral conundrum that needs to be compared apples to apples is plain laughable. Theres a reason law is segregated into different spheres/sections and it is not applied equally in every section, let alone every nation. The whole point of realpolitik and realism is that nations do not act on moral principles but on geopolitical and material interests. And that those nations will sometimes go to extreme lengths to justify those actions and/or what they consider to be vital interests. This is what Mearsheimer and Stone are saying, not that there shouldn't be a moral discussion about how nations act, simply that there is no such (or that it is secondary) discussion when nations form their politics that guard their national interests.

This comparison that he made is similar  to how economists try to tell people that a nation's economy needs to be kept tidy like that of a household economy. Omitting naturally the fact that there are completely different circumstances and capabilities for the nation compared to the household (for instance a nation can print money, a household can not).

As for nations signing agreements and then not following those charters or agreements to the letter: yes that is truly unfortunate, but that is simply how nations behave. All nations do this,
including his own. It is simply and infortunately the world we live in. Nations uphold treaties and charters as long as it benefits them and break them or omit them when they are inconvenient."
763,Not sure if homeboy here realizes the US made a proclamation that NATO wouldn‚Äôt expand. Seems to hold bearing on his whole argument.
764,"36:01 Right...but we also know the perpetrator of the following tragedies: Iraq, Afghanistan, Panama, Liberia, Haiti, Somalia, Philippines, Libya, Iran, Bolivia, Chile, Honduras, Lebanon, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, Oman, Indonesia, just to name a few examples. How about we go farther than that? we don't need to but let's go farther...how about Yemen? we don't even need to imagine that one, but probably this guy was too busy memorizing all the international agreements and the email he got from the CIA before going to this interview."
765,"Thank You Lex for inviting Stephen right after Oliver Stone. I think it's a great way to discuss some of the hard topics. As a Ukrainian, I believe Stone's view is simply wrong so it's great to see Kotkin's response."
766,"Thanks for this. After the interview mit Oliver Stone, this restored my faith in your channel and to people being able to analyze fairly and with open eyes"
767,"I can‚Äôt wait for the next podcast episode, hopefully to remove the aftertaste of this one."
768,I've never heard such crap about West West West.. he thinks it's all hunky Dory in west..
769,Are we still developing people of SK's caliber?  A great man.
770,That‚Äôs interesting. I never knew the reasons people rape was because of because of fear of being raped by the girl in the short skirt. Great analogy.
771,"I‚Äôve read most of Kotkin‚Äôs books and enjoy his work, but he can be strongly biased on some issues, which can be a turn off.  The use of some analogies are also sometimes straw man like.  Was a great listen though. Much appreciated, Lex!"
772,Jesus! He's said LOVE already! Where's my shot glass? The drinking game is off to a flying start.
773,Nice to see the greatest NEOCON historian again Stephen Kotkin - the man who speaks a million words and conveys very little meaning.
774,Come stop by and I won't disappoint you!
775,"This conversation should be a mandatory watch in every k to 12 school, college and law school"
776,Very Ivy leagues and fellow of the Hoover institute.  That disqualifies him as a reliable historian
777,"Despite your controversial podcast with Stone we are waiting for you in Ukraine. Hope you will come, see and show the real situation to your viewers."
778,"oliver stone could write countless letters, on words he still ended defending putin"
779,cleansing interview‚Äî esp after being Stoned
780,Lex can you please get Timothy Snyder on your podcast to talk about Ukraine war?
781,Great Man and great Mind.
782,This guy sounds like any other pro American/western propagandist
783,"I‚Äôve read the comments before watching the video and most of them are very positive. But after that I saw an analogy with raper and a woman in NY. Seriously. I don‚Äôt really appreciate analogies when trying to explain smth. As for me all of them are used to make people think in a particular way (analogies are usually simpler than the original situation, but can‚Äôt repeat the exact situation ). And now I understand why I don‚Äôt appreciate it"
784,"Lex is right. He's struggling to ""dance""."
785,"He's the Joe Pesci of History.... ""You good wi dat?"""
786,Kotkin's portrait of Ukraine as a democracy that doesn't murder anyone is laughable.
787,Amazing thoughts!
788,"More information here 
the new atlas      the duran   
Blessings"
789,Kotkin is man as eminently sensible as he is intelligent and informed -- not something you can always say about the very bright.
790,Does anyone know where I can find the book from Nikolai Leonov? Mentioned at 28:20
791,"Its just silly to go to Russia at this time, regardless of your good intentions."
792,"Lex, hard to overstate the importance and value of the analysis that comes out of this interview! Well done!
Wondering still however: Would you still want to interview Putin? In some former podcast you stated that you would be thrilled to do that, appearing fascinated by him... Just curious if your stance changed about that recently (ignoring that it's even less realistic now). 
In my humble opinion, I believe that if you were to get your (maybe former) wish granted, it might not be as exciting as you maybe imagined. He'd be just hiding behind a thick wall of rhetoric and delusions. Many a former villain, when interviewed after some years (eg in retirement) are just intransigent, defending their past choices viciously, illogically. Might be historically interesting, but hardly ever enlightening..."
793,Kotkin is a bright human.
794,"Sorry, Lex, but this interviewee's speech sounds very naive sometimes. Comparing Ukraine to a woman with a short skirt isn't even close to a reasonable analogy."
795,"Very informed speaker and enjoy his compelling delivery .  Yet, he shows strong Western biases that makes him blind to understanding Russian points of view.   Too much emphasis on protecting status quo which is in US interests."
796,"Stone never argued that Russia's hand was forced the way Kotkin strawmans him to have said that. He said Russia being forced should have choosen another path (by letting ethnic Russians into Russia). Also Stone never argued that NATO expansion was the sole reason for the war, instead he argued that the supposed and somewhat documented bullying of the Russian minorities and facing them with highly nationalistic paramilitary units was one of the main factors. Moreover you cannot but laugh the argumentation of the red ""skirted woman"", while referring to the Iraq war and US perpetrated wars as ""mess"". Also as a historian he should be aware of the Monroe doctrine, which literally makes each country in the American continent a lady being anytime victim by having red skirt. Not to mention the all time bullying of countries that doesn't want to conform US interests. I mean this guy has really a distorted view about US wars, where if the US decides on a political expansion it is a ""mess"" created by a faction of the US, which is not the US's crime somehow, but if any other country does it it is criminal. Sure the latter is true and should be applied to either Russia or the US or any other country. This is by the way how Oliver Stone applied logic, and how anyone believing himself to be a logical human should. So no, he could be a great scholar, but he is not a clear thinker to me..."
797,Right sector rose up against Yanokovich! The south and east of Ukraine resisted Yanokovich‚Äôs overthrough.
798,Im shocked at how in the dark lex is on this invasion.
799,This interview was nothing short of totally inspirational.
800,I don't think he understandings how having  jets with nuclear missile capacity  and nuclear bunker missiles in Poland and perhaps one day in Ukraine is a First Strike Opportunity more important navy ships in the Black Sea
801,If that more necessary than ever quality LUCIDITY was illustrated by a conversation....thank you.
802,It‚Äôs still as corrupt as ever...
803,"44:55 ""nato doesn't attack, it defends members if they're attacked"" I dont know if this guy either oblivious or willfully ignorant over the nato attack over Libya, abhorent nothingness coming out of this guys mouth tbh."
804,wasn't mao in power longer than stalin?
805,Having Oliver Stone and Stephen Kotkin on together for the next show would be great
806,I feel like this guy learned a lot about persuasion from The Godfather.
807,Lex. If you go to Ukraine you will need to be on East and west. I'm sure you will understand a lot more.
808,1:26:00
809,It's always good to get the views of Joe Pesci on such important international events.
810,why arent the us presidents in the same building as Putin?
811,"Prayers for your safety during the trip to your homeland. Please be careful. We'd be lost without you, Alexei.Ô∏è"
812,This guy should be in the State Department.  I've never heard anyone paint such a clear picture of Russian-Western relations.
813,"An exceptionally articulate guest, with a deep and well educated understanding of Russia, the Soviet Union, the actions of the Soviet Union and the values that they spread to their neighbors and all those they touch. Lex himself points out - rightly so - that his guest's ""powerful, precise, rigorous words stand in stark contrast"" with a recent conversation he had with Oliver Stone. Indeed, Mr Kotikin has clearly studied attentively the Soviet Union, its traits, habits and - most importantly - actions, whereas Stone appears to be shooting from the hip almost every time he opens his mouth (which is why he is often wrong and sometimes even ridiculous)."
814,Whats with funny voices? I just watched some Zelenskii stuff and there are pronounced similarities. Is it because people like the clown voices subconsciously?
815,This is great. Please have on Sean Penn and V. Nuland.
816,"pride could be a horror if losing his war, I pray not!"
817,"Really liked this chat, especially when he said ""the bombing of the twin towers"" i would loved to have heard you unpack that 'slip' of the tongue."
818,The very fact that Kotkin compared Russian escalation in Ukraine to a rape and then hallucinated Stone's response to that rape shows the quality of his scholarship. Disappointing.
819,"Great interview, would have been epic if you had Oliver Stone sitting there to push back."
820,I would ask your guest the same question about if the Russian men and woman of the military would fire the nuclear weapons. Would he have the same hope that if the situation is on the US side that the men and women of the US military would not fire that was given by the US president.

822,So many Russian fans here. I dare any of you to move to Russia.  It is paradise. Lol.
823,"Good interview, however, in the signed charter/treaty it says,""you can't expand your alliances at the expense of other countries safety"" ""Kotkin"" didn't mention it and also rape comparison doesn't make any sense..."

826,"New drinking game... Every time the name Lex is said, drink. Good luck"
827,Insanely simplistic view of the cold war that leaves out most of the relevant facts
828,Very clever delivery.
829,"It Is wonderful to hear such an honest appraisal of the enduring unprincipled political weakness of the west, and the familiar and ongoing Russian self sacrificial tragedy.. The moral is the practical. Where are the practical actions from either side? Self interested Practical actions would sort the world out rapidly, but you need principled office holders to carry this forward. Knottin for President, and hard money might manage it?"
830,This guy is so condescending
831,"if an american tells you its in the genes of the russian nation to be aggressive or invasive, then ask for the genes of the US nation or better lough.."
832,"Great conversation. As Pole I can not agree more with Mr Kotkin. His knowledge about Russia is amazing. We here in Poland know Russia very well through our history of Russian invasions and Russia terror.
Thanks Lex"
833,For such topics it would be much more interesting if you had Oliver Stone and him on the same podcast and just let them debate back and forth
834,"Interesting, informative,- but why does he have to be so condescending"
835,Listening from Herzlia.....fascinatingly interesting!
836,Wow! So biased
837,"Oliver Stone and Stephen Klotkin together is who we'd love to hear, if it were possible. Your interviews are captive to your audience!"
838,This man is amazing to listen to.
839,"Please invite Andrey Illarionov, a Russian economist and former senior policy advisor to Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, from April 2000 to December 2005. Since April 2021 he is as a senior fellow at the Center for Security Policy in Washington, DC."
840,"Love and appreciate your explorations. Your podcast reaches a lot people and your voice, your work is important."
841,Incredible interview! Someone should take the transcript and publish it as a book.
842,Doomberg?
843,"Two of my favorite people to listen to for knowledge...awesome, thank you."
844,"Wonderful wonderful kotkin, finally someone who says it like it is !!! I had to unsubscribe. This lex guy really is against democracy, his way of talking is very strange and dangerous... I 100% AGREE with kotkin"
845,‚ÄúHe‚Äôs in the same building‚Ä¶‚Äù lol what?‚Ä¶ this is great insight?!
846,Amazing and thoughtful analysis on current geopolitics from a guy I never heard about. Thanks Lex!
847,Safe travels my friend.. thanks  for the work you do !
848,"It is more like last century conversation. You do not compare Stalin or Hitler with Putin as most historians like to do in a classroom. The context is totally different.  And you do not think Ukraine democracy is such a naive term when our domestic electing politics is in such a mess. And you do not label people or country at the present based on some historic events or perceptions.  I suggest both Stephen and Lex should go live in Russia for a longer period of time and learn the language and the culture for a more deep understanding. Communist parties were targets of attack in the West for centuries. But, the truth is there is no such thing as communism exists in our time now. Please wake up!"
849,"I really respect that the flow of the convo is as important to you as it is to viewers. That in and of itself shows that your motives are to exchange ideas and to find understanding, not making money. Nothing wrong with making money but focusing on money doesn't further the global conversation and sharing of experiences. Your empathy, curiosity and integrity are apparent both in your conduct and in your choice of words. We all appreciate that you don't compromise yourself to appease anyone or anything (as you should), positive vibrations your way and your trip I pray goes smoothly, much love my G. Stay black"
850,Putins model ruler is Stalin  with a tinge of peter the great. Born and raised in St Petersburg Putin is steeped in that west reverse engineering he'd presume to catch up. The longer he stays in power the more he imitates Stalin as an autocrat of the vast bureaucracy.  Though the scale of terror is lower it still exists visa vie any potential rivals to his throne. Many poisoned marginalized silenced. Isolated insulated from alternative points of view there is only one point of view. Ie a paranoid conspiratorial fear based egoistic view which they attempt to export.  They see soft power by the west as taking with one hand and denying its salutary effect with the other hand. Now with sanctions they don't understand the loss of soft money. Politically they're stirring the populace against the stealing robber oligarchs they're bureacratically in bed with. Suddenly the west draws the line on the ukraine invasion as being outside the world legal order and Putin claims the west has started a new cold war. Bizarro world. So glad SK has destroyed the Oliver Stone and John Mearsheimer russian apologetics.
851,"Hey Lex, I know you likely won't be able to read this. I like your channel and have watched it for years. I want to ask you something to consider. You've had many Liberal experts who are hostile to Communism/Socialism. There are other perspectives on these topics and I would like to challenge you to host and question an avowed Socialist on your show, and ask them similar questions. You might be surprised by their answers. Thank you."
852,"Lex, you are such a gift. Thank you."
853,"What an amazing podcast with Stephen, he totally blew me away with his insights, perspective, truth and humility, etc! Wow! so wonderful to listen to such a real human being! thank you to both of you Lex & Stephen for this!"
854,36:01
855,My heart and love  go out to lex. Safe travels 
856,Complete larp + headcanon
857,"I just recently found your channel and  want to thank you for great interviews. It was interesting to hear different views on current situation from respectable people. However, I think that this particular interview represents idealistic view  on Russia, Western countries, Ukraine, China and modern democracy. The fact is that all the countries involved in this conflict doesn't uphold democratic principles and international agreements. I'm as a russian can't see any ""just"" party in modern conflict. And the final statements about Navalny is just absurd, I'm actually from Kirov, where Navalny worked for several years and all the people, who know him personally, wonder, how he didn't get in jail here for economic crimes. I didn't hear any positive statements about the man from anybody here. He doesn't even have a solid political program, his only supporters is school kids and young students in Moskow and Petersburg. Him as a prime minister candidate is absolutely unacceptable for russians, it's simply cannot be, except in the situation, when Russia is divided and nearly destroyed.   If his reputation in the West is truly that high (which i doubt) it sais more negative things about level of western political insight."
858,"Lex, don't know if you read this but i listened  to you and Rogan on a long bike ride yesterday. 
As usual, you two were fantastic.  Funny, loving, playful, soulful.  
I want you to know the podcast where you interviewed your dad, was one of the best i have ever listened to.  
My dad and i skied through the pandemic. One Saturday morning i played that podcast to and from the ski hill.  
My dad's parents came from Radom Poland in the 1930's.  His Dad spoke with a thick Yiddish accent, and my dad had tears in his eyes listening to you interview your dad.  Thank you, for sharing your life with us.  

Please, take care when you go on your trip.

861,thank you - nice to hear someone with command of the facts on both sides - very thought provoking!
862,Rotten to the core.

868,there is no Ukraine.
869,This is just gold plated love 
870,This should have millions of views /facepalm
871,"Navalny second most powerful ... you must be kidding. Yes, ""west/USA"" (EU is just a subset of satellites and non-sovereign nations, at least in this context) definitely would love that and even make him President of Ru so as to bring her (Russia) to their orbit. Few more other point of views, not historical facts, that I do not agree with. Otherwise, this was indeed a very good and interesting interview to listen to."
872,@Lex  thank you for all your shows.  Be safe on your travels. Let the white light shine.
873,I can‚Äôt see Navalny being offered a post in the Putin regime. He‚Äôs been too openly opposed to them for too long.
874,"Lex, you are struggling because or your roots and that's only an emotional perspective, but your rational is telling you someting else."
875,Lex another tremendous interview.
876,So Joe Pesci is now a historian?
877,"Thanks, Lex, for talking to an expert. 

I could not bring myself to listen to Oliver Stone, who obscenely serves Putin."
878,Kotkin is a national treasure. Thx lex
879,"Mr. Kotkin is one of a few western experts on Russia, its history of 20 century and its leaders,  that actually knows what he is talking about and is very precise in his analysis and statements. Also he is a great speaker."

902,"For this guy to say Putin is Delusional, that the US wants to destroy Russia , throws the rest of his comments out the window , nice try."
903,"Lex. Your opening words relating to personal objectives re; Russia and Ukraine made me very proud of you, and also very sad for you. You are a good Man. God bless and please protect you and yours... my friend. "

928,"My my my, what a great interview."
929,The fact he says your name ‚ÄúLex‚Äù so often is an indication of something fishy.
930,"I would love to travel to Ukraine and Russia with you, friend."
931,"He almost in one sentence said that ""NATO does not invade, it's just a defensive alliance"" and then that ""NATO invaded Iraq""."

936,"Lex, Thank You. Please consider reaching out to Karel van Wolferen with these same concerns."
937,Kotkin is a brillant dude. Just when I think he's making a point that's biased or unsupportive he flips it to the other side and gives you the other perspective. His analogies need a little work
938,"You called him one of your favourite human beings ü•π
Wow this is a no from me. He‚Äôs so full of his own biases. 
Next time ask him who funded his books on Stalin. 
If your Russian is still passable you should listen to Spizin, a real historian and an expert on Stalin and Soviet Union. Spizin speaks plainly, worts and all, minus all this badly hidden passive aggressive Russophobia your guest has. 
First interview of yours I‚Äôve bailed on after the first 30 minutes. Sorry, but he can never be your friend. Not really. Don‚Äôt be gullible –®—É—Ä–∞."
939,44:50 ‚ÄúNATO doesn‚Äôt attack‚Äù. What about Yugoslavia‚Ä¶
940,"At 11:15, Kotkin says it's hard to get into Mao's head, which in a sense is true.
However, both Stalin and Mao were driven by the same ethical ""ideal"", which explains why so many chose to go along with them with religious zeal.

They did not believe the individual to be important in comparison to their ""greater good"". There were collectivists. So if you need to kill a few million individuals, deride them as self-interested, and justify it by saying the chosen ""greater good"" will ""benefit"", then it will be done with murderous fervor. Stalin and Mao both considered individuals to be cogs in a machine. And if a cog ""malfunctions"", and tries to follow its own reason and judgement instead of the group's, you destroy it.

But we are not cogs in a machine. A ""greater good"" does not rightfully override the life and choices of an individual. An individual is the one who thinks. The one who chooses to live or die. The one who eats and loves. The one who achieves. Each and every one of your lives is yours. You only get one, and no one can live it for you. No one, not a class, nor god, nor race has the moral right to make you do something except you."
941,Am in tears after listening to this. You and Your guest show such compassion. Thank you for caring and bringing us on your ride seeking understanding from different perspectives. Good luck and safety in your travels. I hope you accomplish what you seek to accomplish. Sanity and Peace is my hope from here.
942,War is always expensive for all sides no matter what type of war it is
943,Will the west be willing to support Ukraine financially for many months and years? If not it may just be delaying the inevitable.
944,Great knowledge
945,"India is not supporting Russia in this war. I am not sure what made you say that. India has always had a non alignment policy since Cold War days. We do not support one side or the other. We have a good relationship with USA, EU countries and Russia. Even in United Nations we have not voted one way or another, trying to maintain neutrality. What India imports from Russia is a fraction of what many EU countries import in one afternoon. This is not the first time you have major flaws in your comments about India."
946,"When the talked about the peaceful take overs of the West, he lost all credibility."
947,"Great conversation, but his 'Nuclear War' arguments at around 1:42 are steeped in false information.

1. Modern nuclear weapons have very little fallout. They go boom very clean - and destroy what's on the ground. Conflating this with a dirty power-plant explosion's fallout is comparing apples to helicopters. Irrelevant.

2. ""the guys on the ground might decide not to go along with instructions"" is also kinda BS. ICBMs would be the attack route. Submarines (cut off from the world, clueless about anything going on on the surface, ready to launch when told to) would be the attack route. Not bombers. Sheesh, who has nuclear bombers as first line of offense these days? ICBMs and Subs will both launch when told. And that's terrifying, yes."
948,"take a shot every time Kotkin says ""Lex"""
949,"I didn't make it through the whole thing yet but I'm genuinely curious- if the reasoning behind Russian aggression is false, who are those people of whom photos can be found on telegram. The ones of Young battered men with military fatigues that have clearly visible swastikas, iron crosses and other Nazy symbols tattooed on them? Is that Russian propaganda too? Are those tattoos henna or something?

Also, while applying to join NATO or UE is a sovereign decision of each eligible country, aren't Russian concerns legitimate? After all, US government has been meddling in the region long before Maidan.  

I really like this podcast (while being heartbroken for the human suffering that takes place, not only in Ukraine to be fair)- the guest is well spoken and interesting but I somehow feel like he's omitting some facts that should have been brought up to see a clearer picture."
950,Stephen Kotkin I love you!
951,Fallacious dichotomy after fallacious dichotomy.
952,"Thank you for balancing this interview as good as anyone could hope. Kotkin is way to aggressively opinionated ""historian"" for me to sit through the whole interview though. Oliver Stone and him in the same room would probably be the same as this, only with a silent Stone in the room, waiting for space to enter the Kotkins monologue"
953,"Amazing insights and I could not agree more with Kotkin. At the same time, I'm profoundly embarrassed and shocked about the totally wrong and misinformed perspective of Oliver Stone in his interview."
954,"Putin, Stalin, Hitler.
The trilogy most often discussed in world news."
955,"I Love You too, Lex.  Spiral out, Brother."
956,Your a great interviewer and human been be careful my friend
957,"I love seeing so many differing opinions! 

I've had to stop talking to family and friends about these topics because I'm immediately pegged as a  'conspiracy theorist' because I'm open and honest that I have no freaking clue what's going on but I want to hear what everyone thinks and use that to build a perspective, not to pick a side, because in truth I have no idea what is real and fake anymore and I refused to be a pawn in someone else's game.

This podcast is like a cup of warm milk for my lonely soul, for a brief period of the day I feel like I'm conversing with open-minded people who care. 

Thank you all for being here."
958,"I was curious to know what you think of Elons gibberish ramblings on how woke-ism wont get us to Mars, or was that a fake tweet?  so hes not the revolutionary kind !?"
959,"I was open minded when I started this video, but the way Kotkin speaks sounds like a gaslighter. We all know the U.S. has snakes. He's talking like that's completely outlandish to even think. I'm not a fan so far but will definitely keep watching and hopefully I see a slight change in his negativity."
960,"Thank you for the interview. I stopped listening to this guy after the first 20 minutes. This man either doesn‚Äôt know history of politics between western and Soviets, or telling lies consciously. I am Russian, I don‚Äôt support Putin‚Äôs regime, but even I understand that this guy is not saying the truth."
961,"Vasili Aleksandrovich Arkhipov and Stanislav Petrov are two Russians whose names you should know when discussing dual-key missile launch.
The world owes them both an incalculable debt."
962,"maybe its just me, because I have a very dirty mind, but if he just change the word Russia by USA there will be no difference, he its just describing USA in every sentence."
963,I touch myself to Lex's opening monologues and I bet I'm not alone.
964,Lot of big sighs from Lex on this one
965,"Good interview, Lex. Now Lex, that this has all been Westplained to you , Lex, I hope, Lex, you,understand. Ok? Our rules, ,Lex, our, institutions, Lex, nothing can change Lex, resistance is futile."
966,"You are scaring me. Please do not put yourself in danger. I understand the
 Led Fridman Entity has no boundaries in depth of knowledge it provides, however Lek, please do not risk anything  in your travel to the East. Sometimes it‚Äôs better to take a step back   Once again thank you for sharing. Mo"
967,"33:00 ‚Äúcan you say bla bla bla‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ‚Äúno you can‚Äôt say that, lex‚Äù   Interesting tactic by asking the interviewer and then answering the question for him. He would make a great dictator himself. It‚Äôs interesting to hear his viewpoints"
968,As to the Russian military cohesion: there‚Äôs precedent of it dissolving & turning homeward ‚Äî 1917?
969,"37:00 Going for sexual violence metaphor indicates that Stephen interested in your emotional response rather than in rational analisys of his metaphor.

But if you remove the emotional component, whats left is just a pointless metaphor.

- Why did you shoot this man?
- Because he broke into my house!
Kotkin: Imagine a woman got r**ed, imagine she got r**ed for wearing a short skirt, now imagine she got r**ed because she just entered some man's house!

- Why allied forces invaded Germany in 1945?
- Well, because Germany started world war in 1939..
Kotkin: Imagine a woman got r**ed for crossing a border of foreign country..

The argument is that the reasons for the action are not important, but only your decision to act is. I wonder what a judge would think about this type of logic? ""No acquittals on my watch"" - says Kotkin - ""and say goodbye to extenuating circumstances"". And you should ignore the hypocrisy and unintelligence of his argument because he pushed on your compassion by talking about sexual assault. When somebody tries to turn you away from looking for reasons, there is something they don't want you to find.

I personally find that this whole talk about who is to blame is bogus, designed to create a consent for ""the current thing"". There is no jury and no prosecutor in geopolitics. Ultimately, Oliver Stone has a wiser position, since he actually explained the reasons and interests. While Stephen just pushing current media narrative: Putin might be delusional, Russia is bad, blame Russia. Go ahead and blame all you want, this won't help you get any wiser. I mean, do you really expect some actual expertise from a guy who just said (15:08) that ""Navalny is the second most important person in Russia"".

PS: Later he goes on and mentions bunch of treaties ignoring the fact that US backed coup in Ukraine in 2014 was a direct violation of them aswell. But you should not think about it because imagine a woman got r**ed for wearing a short skirt. Here is another idea: imagine that Ukraine is Serbia and Russia is US."
970,You get the feeling Lex is gonna get whacked after this interview..
971,"Kotkin's performance here makes me doubt the value of his Stalin biography.  He's overly legalistic. He also chooses weak metaphors, which Lex sensed. Frankly he sounds like the smartest kid in the room with little experience of power and the real world. One example...
*
Geography is always an important factor. It affects history which creates culture. And culture isn't some abstract essentialism. It's a storehouse of encoded experience.  Which affects and probably even creates emotions. You still make choices, but fear and humiliation can easily and perhaps always overwhelm rationality and cost-benefit analysis.  Kotkin missed the core of his hedge fund saying. Investing is about managing fear and greed.  Few do it well.
*
Kotkin acts like fear isn't real. Just because I ought to be able to walk in a crime ridden area at night, doesn't mean I should do it. And certainly not without paying attention.  Or assuming everyone is law-abiding. Assume guns are loaded and snakes are dangerous.  Heuristics, not law or logic. 

There's a relevant example between two species of squirrels. One buries their food for the winter in one place. The other in many different places. Guess which one fights if another squirrel discovers their food.

Knowing your enemy matters. Especially if there from another culture and seem irrational."
972,1:47:30 this is kind of a fairytale he speaks at in this moment because Russia is using the very small Percentage of their military capabilities
973,"In listening, it is like Poe‚Äôs Law. At times I can‚Äôt discern if this is satire or not. This guy is certifiably nuts. Reality TV government is great? Nukes can be fired without destroying civilization? Kookoo for Coco puffs. WTF?"
974,You‚Äôre so drama queen at the beginning  everything will be ok in Russia for sure))
975,My God this guy is Amazing ! Wow The way he lays out the narrative.
976,"Hey digital archivist of the future, thankyou for archiving LEX FRIDMAN, some of you will also try to create an artificial model of LEX FRIDMAN to interact with ,please mention this comment as well "
977,"Interesting interview that provides insight into the mind of a biased silo-thinker from the US. Still convinced that the motives of Russia are fed by the ultimate desire to compare itself to the West. Taking the West as the starting point for all of his analysis, analysis which is pervaded with emotional and value based arguments, absent of any kind of self reflection. Could it also be that Russia wants to determine its own destiny and attach value to what they think is important perhaps? The  answers and thoughts provided by Oliver Stone were way more balanced and well thought out in my view. Respect for the interviewer by the way, doing a great job."
978,"I do have a sense that Stephen is living in his own academic bubble and really doesn't understand why populist movements like Trump appeal to the masses. Also I feel he doesn't understand that yes the institutions the west created, or more accurately the Anglo sphere, are well designed the problem is the people we have in charge of these institutions. We need a different type of person in these institutions to stop the terrible divisions and weakness in Western society."
979,"44:50 ""Nato is a defense alliance...Nato doesn't attack"" 
Even though I agree with most of his views, this statement is not true. The bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999. was done as an act of aggression, against international law, civil targets were hit and civilians killed."
980,Kotkin's analysis is very shallow and predicated on motivational thinking. The trick here is to be objective and get under the skin of the problem. History is not black and white.
981,Is it legal for the USA to help Ukraine target Russians and Russian assets?
982,"""...you cool with that?..."" "
983,"LF Needs A More Dialectical Approach

As good as LF is, esp. when conversing w/ people whose expertise overlaps his own, LF really falls short in programs like this, where there is a political component.  

Stephen Kotkin is a valuable, most informative guest, but he made several claims and arguments that a better interviewer would have tried to clarify, to better reveal their strengths and weaknesses.  Kotkin used one analogy that LF even described as emotionally persuasive if nothing else, but Lex then stumbled around and said he could not come up w/ an appropriate counter to Kotkin's emotional pitch.  WTF?

Lex, you're a martial artist -- please show a little more of that artistry when your guests throw such big fat pitches (yes, metaphors mixed...)

I have the same criticism for the Oliver Stone interview/conversation, so I'm not writing from a partisan pov other than wanting to be better informed."
984,Are sanctions and embargo‚Äôs acts of war?
985,Ukraine aren't killing journalists.  Lol.
986,It should be fairly obvious at this point that Stephen should debate Oliver in person with lex moderating it
987,"who are these two Russian speaking angels disguised as human beings !!!! what insight what compassion  Oh Lord of the Universe, Oh Holy One of Israel  protect President Zelensky  another noble son of Abraham"
988,The distance from Ukrainian border to Moscow is less than 500 kilometres (290 miles)
989,Well done with your guests but I hear John Mearsheimer  name all the time on these pod casts you all need to get him on and Peter Hitchens would be a fantastic guest with another point of view
990,Spoken like a true neocon.
991,"""The Ukranian resistance, to Russian agression, was one of the great gifts the West has ever received."" Fuck yeah, this statement (1:06:12) gave me chills."
992,"An epic conversation. I criticised a lot the arguments of Oliver Stone, and Stephen put it brilliantly why. No demagogy, no convenient manipulative facts, only examples and wrestling with the concrete ideas, not with whataboutism and conspiracy like soft dilusions like Oliver and some soft West politicians do novadays. I will share this with all my friends, Stephen managed to fill in almost any contextual gap in this violent tragedy of Ukranian invasion and long lasting Russia as a state strategy (as well as strategies of many autoritarian regimes). 
Thanks a lot, Lex, for bringing these contrasts and letting us decide between good and evil ourselves. :)"
993,"Love the intellectual insites... raising children who""s values nothing less than the greatness of Russia will override any hardship, suffering in their eyes. Six million people left their country because of the war, all Europe taking care of this war immigrants, Zelensky instead of thanking all the leader's in Europe calling them out, ( especially Hungary) that the country is not providing him with weapons, telling them what to do, bullying a Country's President,  Viktor Orban who never forgets how Zelensky treated the minority Hungarians .. He is demanding but people in Hungary  don't forget his actions against their own people... Hungarians are just as proud of their heritage as other countries in Europe. This war will weaken  Europe badly, perhaps there is a reason they will not fulfill his demands after all!  There will be never a United Europe... all countries share the fact, their love for their country and the people, and they all speak different languages... and proud of their heritage just like Russians...some of them leaved through russian therror...people don't forget!"
994,40 mins in and something is off with this guy. Seems like he has an axe to grind...
995,"you just made my day Ô∏è. I was desperately trying to find out something from this great Professor  , about the current situation in Ukraine,  and I find this MEGA interview.  Very well done Sir. By the way,  I would like to recommend on the current situation in Chile üá®üá± The land of the experiments. Jumping from a democratic Marxist election in the 70's , to a military coup 11/9/1973 (Pinochet) .
Then adopting the free market Friedman/Chicago boys economic policy.  Making it the Switzerland of Latin-America. And now  through violent demonstrations  (many believe the radical left , the communist Leninist Party,  which is in the government now ,and a 
( kind of FARC) + public discontent is behind . They are trying to dismantle the constitution to a more totalitarian system,  of course disguised in a million good of intentions. I thought it would be worth mentioning. Keep save both of you.  Peace Ô∏èand freedom Ô∏è 
Greetings from
Chile üá®üá±"
996,Get Laurence Rees on your show
997,Nice content mate! So happy to announce that I have gained financial freedom by investing in digital currency. Now I know that multi creation of various streams of income is the ideal Principle for financial sustainability.
998,"This guys argument is very 1 sided. I agree with most of what he says about Russia but almost everything he levels at Putin the west is also guilty of, you just don't see it on CNN. He also takes a high horse position and talks to Lex like he knows nothing. Not a fan of Stephen Kotkin anymore, just as much as I'm not a fan of Putin!"
999,"Lex is great as usual. Kotkin not so much. No political realism here, but sadly it is the current point of view."
1000,"Perhaps listening to President Putins address to the UN 2007,  might clarify what he thinks and his goals for Russia. Listen to the man himself.  Also the interviews Oliver Stone conducted."
1001,"Stephen Kotkin actually is a national treasure. Thank you, Lex, for hosting him again."
1002,These guys are drowning in hypocrisy. Take the log out of your own eye
1003,I see Russia as another country trying to play the imperialist game. I‚Äôm not moved because they are less good at it than others. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
1004,"you cool with that?
you cool with that? 
you cool with that?
you good with that Lex?"
1005,"Thoughtful podcast, but i think he misses the point that Oliver Stone tried to make - Russian (Slavic) people have another way of thinking and doing their business. If you analyze them through a western magnifying glass, then they could be seen as totalitarian. But if you live in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus etc... with their history and culture, then Putin looks like a pretty good leader."
1006,"America are top dog and we should all know our place 50km from the end of an American missile. The rape analogy was putrid and nonsensical. Like to listen to all sides but was dissapointed at the lack of critical analysis and challenge. Anyone who has listened to Putin would realise that he has no delusions about Russian power compared with the power that  America wields he just doesn't want to be held hostage to their influence, nuclear and financial threat. We have nearly accidentally gone to nuclear war on a couple of occasions if Finland join NATO it will cut the thinking time from 9 minutes to 4 minutes. Neo cons are an absolute danger but nobody is restraining them we live in scary times."
1007,"I am surprised how ignorant sometimes Mr Kotkin is on the current situation in Russia/Ukraine and how biased he is. The longer I listen to him talking the more disgusted I am with how one-sided he is. Russia constantly conquering its neighbors? USA never starts any wars every few years and destroying whole countries? NATO is a defensive alliance? and destroying Iraq, Yugoslavia!

On 50th min I gave up. This Mr Kotkin is just another person who can't think objectively and independently. Or this is his intention."
1008,"39:10 let's not get confused about nato and the reasons it was founded. Why Ukrain need nato nor Russia for self uplifting. Ukrain has everything to be prosperous. What we have now, they being used by two flexing powers to resolve who gets what. Hypocracy or Lack of knowladge all other the spectrum!
PS
Any politician that acts on the emotions of the current situation is part of the problem. God is the witness."
1009,Can anyone point me to a spot where he answers the question about Ukraninas actions in Dombas before Russia invades? The thing that Russians mostly take as an excuse except the nato.
1010,The rape metaphor sums it up. Oliver Stone knows  it better.
1011,"I was wondering how anyone could respond gracefully when Kotkin used the rape metaphor to illustrate how attempting to join NATO isn't a good excuse for going to war, then Lex pulled out, ""I think there's a lot of people listening to this that will agree to the emotion, power, and spirit of this metaphor. I was struggling how to dance within this metaphor because I feel it wasn't the right one, but I think it captures the spirit"". If that doesn't show how good Lex has gotten at these discussions, I don't know what does."
1012,People like Kotkin and interviews like this substitute for a quiet father.
1013,"Was giving him a chance until he used the rape metaphor. Not once did he mention US led coups. Illegal invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan etc. And the millions killed. Can't help thinking this guy is ignorant of colonial history. Letting is fuel here Lex."
1014,In so much of this - just replace ‚Äôthe west‚Äô with people/investors/etc.
1015,"A question to be answered is, will the West deserve the sacrifice the Ukrainians have made or will we waste it? I have little confidence in Western leadership. They have much to prove to their own people. On the positive side, the Davos crowd has had a couple of very bad years, with the world getting an up-close-and-personal demonstration of how their global organizations function in a crisis. pretty unimpressive, to be kind. I see they are working on a software update. Klaus, the Boy from Brazil who escaped, is still committed."
1016,Get John Mesheimer on there w this guy - talk about an intellectual battle
1017,"44:50 ""nato is a defensive alliance"", ok enough of your one sided propaganda.  Did you forget when nato bombed an independent Yugoslavia in 1999?  no nato country was under any threat from Yugoslavia.  There was nothing defensive about that bombing."
1018,I don't think I've seen a less informed discussion about what has been going on in the current conflict on the internet.  Congrats Lex.
1019,–°—Ç–∞–ª–∏–Ω –≤–æ–æ–±—â–µ-—Ç–æ –Ω–µ russian!
1020,Huge respect for Stephen Kotkin from Ukraine. One of the few public speakers I hear in the West who gets the situation so well.
1021,"Not here to simp for Lex but just wanted to say this guest is far far lest intelligent as i had hoped and he is delusional to the point that his bias and ideology blinds him to the truths and reality of his description of what happened, what is happening, and what will or what is the best out come....I disagree with all he said so dont let his big words fool you"
1022,"As I conclude from this interview, the West is ""very good and wants to help everyone"". Then explain to me why that same West disintegrated Yugoslavia and bombed my country, Serbia, without UN permission. Does that also belong to ""helping the poor people"". I just ask how you are not ashamed and how you are not ashamed of your actions, you who do not stop fighting and destroying other countries all this time since the end of the Second World War. And all under the pretext of ""help""."
1023,"Lex has the best podcast going, but he has a massive blindspot for Putin/Russia and what theyre doing right now"
1024,"He's great, but he is too western. For example our financial system is a complete mess"
1025,"I have a hard time listening to this speaker without getting emotional. He draws Russia and its history from a purely western perspective. As if the western values could be applied to Russian thinking and acting. With this he makes exactly the same mistakes as the western political leaders who think that they can impose their values on other ethnicities, regions and countries. Doing that they use means like extortion monetary control, wars, atrocities conducted by their intelligence services, militarily in order to provoke those nations which they want to control. And once those Nation States use means available to them including becoming more undemocratic the West uses those as justification to provoke civil unrest, forced government change in those countries. This speaker while historically probably very knowledgeable from a western perspective lacks to capacity to put himself into the shoes of those leaders."
1026,Such a shame to see a great historian be so one sided...
1027,"38:00 I observed of the treaties signed by Russia, as indicated by the historian, there is a clause of Russia's complain: Countries can freely choose their military alliances, but that should not be done at the expense of another country's security.

Also there is an assumption of reports of genocidal actions of the Russian army as true."
1028,"Honestly does this historian live in the archives does he forget the last twenty years .Iraq Syria Libya Afghanistan Yemen 
American Imperium encouraged NATO members to support the narrative"
1029,Wow. An incredible interview. I was not aware of Stephen Kotkin before this video. His knowledge and insight brings to mind  Joseph Campbell. Understanding context thru the noise is so important in these Orwellian times. I appreciate all you are doing Lex - thank you from a grateful fellow human.
1030,"So many lies. Kotkin might not be the Prince of Lies, but he is at least an Earl -- maybe a Marquess of Lies."
1031,"This guy is good at ""appealing to the emotions of the listener""

The rape analogy.
The description of Zelenskyy not leaving the country.

salute to Lex from Kenya!"
1032,"I stopped listening when Kotkin said we are not living in a multi-polar world. If you can make that sort of mistake, you are not to be taken seriously."
1033,"There is a saying history is written by victors (allegedly). His employer should be happy with a good return on investment. Jokes apart, this guy is obviously biased..."
1034,Many Russian words that are hard to translate to English. Very subtle.
1035,"China be like: Tibet is us and we want to retake the full extent of what Tibetan King Trisong Deutsen ruled in the 8th Century. This includes Bhutan, Sikkim, Ladakh, and Arunachal Pradesh. I‚Äôm hearing this from sources in India."
1036,try get Anthony Chaffee MD on podcast
1037,This guy is in a bubble of his own thinking
1038,"It's bizarre the extent to which he believes a war can be won on ""Twitter"". Truly, truly bizarre. John Mearsheimer makes much more sense. ""Twitter"" utterly irrelevant to battlefield victory."
1039,"""Countries are sovereign and free to choose their own foreign policy..."" well unless you are an autocratic country or you are Cuba or you are any Country in the West Hemisphere.."
1040,Thank you for another great interview. Please stay safe! Ô∏è
1041,Thank you so much for this Outstanding Interview! I really appreciated  Stephen Kotkin and his perspective of history.. It was thoroughly engaging and thought provoking.  I could listen to it again...Wishing you both All the Very Best.
1042,"there is so much more info the would challenge all being said by Stephen Kotkin. For instance footage of Lindsey ,McCain and a woman who's name I cant recall from 2020 I think talking about encouraging Ukraine's if not Nazis that when they have conflict with Russia as we encourage we would back them give them all they need. And a few other pieces of info points this to be a proxy war. And I am discouraged at the lack of awareness."
1043,Thank you for your interview it was captivating and emotionally stimulating
1044,Rod Serling and Charlie Rose merged. Lex is the outcome.
1045,Bring back Kotkin anytime!
1046,Truly an excellent interview on so many levels. Thank you Mr Fridman and Mr Kotkin.
1047,This was a great interview!
1048,Kotkin seems biased.
1049,"Thanks for the deeply insightful interview, Lex. Best on your travels."
1050,this guy is super strong in logic but very close minded
1051,"44:59
"" Nato doesn't attack , it defends members if they are attacked ""
Which member of NATO did Serbia attack in 1999 ?"
1052,Thanksgiving to you from all of us in question on so many things. Shedding light on tough subjects is always worth it no matter the cost.
1053,AMAZING interview from both sides. Much respect and thanks for this work.
1054,He sounds like the propaganda we are fed usually. Like what realistic reasons did he give for russia's invasion? Personality?
1055,"I saw you on someone else podcast, I've watched 3 of yours this morning, absolutely fantastic"
1056,Absolutely Love stephen kotkin. Started every sentence with 'Lex' and sounds just like Joe Pesci
1057,"You know, Lex, I've observed that when someone repeats your name over and over, Lex, while they're talking, that, Lex, they're probably not very trustworthy. Lex, they're probably some kind of cheap salesman or manipulator. I have no proof of this, Lex, nor do know whether your guest's opinion, Lex, is right or wrong. But, Lex, I don't trust him. Just sayin', Lex."
1058,"Such a great interview, very informative !"
1059,"Fantastic, the most insightful interview on this subject I have heard. Period."
1060,This is the best analysis I have heard. Great interview. thank you
1061,Thank You Lex for this conversation with Professor Kotkin. He is a remarkable teacher and has great gifts of comprehension and communication.
1062,Robert Leshner Please!
1063,Educational and Informative podcast!
1064,David Irving coming up?
1065,There is no danger in Ukraine for such a great human like Lex!
1066,Again thank you and may the world let you act as an agent of Love and Wisdom !
1067,"Wow, what a great conversation. Please do Part 3 after a few months."
1068,"Kotkin has bought the Zelensky / US narrative big time, otherwise interesting."
1069,Thank you so much for this interview!
1070,YES!
1071,"I don't typically comment but have to express my gratitude for the humanity, insight, intimacy, and sheer magnitude of this conversation. Lex, from the bottom of my heart you inspire me to keep a keen, and critical eye on the present. Dr. Kotkin, as a fellow American that passionately loves history, thank you so much for learning Russian, and further thanks for the insight. Down from the ages - as it goes. Please keep writing. Thank you both for being open and inviting the public to participate in the discourse."
1072,"You are a light in this world with both your mind and words. Thank you, truly.  "
1073,Great interview Lex!
1074,That rape analogy is such bullshit!
1075,"i love you too Lex.......in the past weeks, i stumbled onto your podcasts, no screaming, intelligent discourse, i could go on and on. You are a Son of the Light, chaver, shalom, n."
1076,"I recommended you guys sometime ago,can I get person who invested with her Mrs Camilla mc Coy comment below"
1077,"YESSSSSSSS!!!! I've been waiting for this for this since the last time he was on. Thank you LEXXX! Kotkin is probably my fav Historian, its rare for a historian to have such charisma, his talk with Zizek was both brilliant and hilarious."
1078,"Lex - Thank you so much for being willing to be vulnerable and allowing this important analysis to be heard and available to all.  Your followers could certainly see and feel the emotional toll this broadcast took on you.  It is much appreciated.  Kotkin was amazingly concise and clear and human.  What an incredible podcast.    You are making the world a better place, one listener at a time.  Take care of yourself, you are doing fantastic work here."
1079,"Great interview. Thanks for these thoughts. What strikes though me is how Stephen depicts people in power as making emotion-based decisions - french desiring to be diplomatic superpower, usa trying to agree, russians feeling resentment. Also, expressing one person's statements as justification for the country's actions. I mean, just because Trump reached out to Putin, doesnt mean the entire US agreed with that. Trump or Biden doesnt reflect the entire US establishment. Putin also doesnt reflect the entire Russian government. Each country has many competing internal forces. I was hoping to more names, dates, quotes, and factual comparisons. All these ideas about ""blackening the image"", fighting the evil, ""good/bad guys"", ""freedom and unfreedom"", ""privacy of their own mind"", ""we are gonna punish"", ""to hell with this"" - this is not about history as a research subject. Too many broad concepts and generalisations. Presidents globally aren't some infants. I mean, Stephen is a historian. Can we hear chronology? Or a historian just for the title? Metaphors are relevant, no doubt. But still empty in terms of factual analysis. Stephen seems to use mostly cultural and worldview clash as a key lens in the interview. Also, seems to connect points really superficially and eventually say ""we have to be careful about definitive judgements""."
1080,"Love your interviews Lex, I have learned so much. But I think you should refrain from travelling to either countries until at least a year from now, it's just too dangerous at the moment."
1081,One of the best programs on YouTube.
1082,Bedankt
1083,"Thanks Lex.
You are the best!
We love you - be safe!"
1084,"I listened to the interview with Oliver Stone first and was a bit startled about Oliver's stance because he basically suggested that Putin was right to start this war. But, he never really did, because he never talked about the actual conflict, just all that, in his mind, led up to it. Now, I have met Oliver once on a film project (his film ""Alexander"" which I was happy to not have signed onto for obvious reasons"", and it was a bit of a surreal experience because Oliver is so inherently anti-American in his view of the ""establishment"" of his country. So, how objective can he actually be in regards to the US's decades-long engagement of Putin?
Now, listening to Kotkin, I am hearing a lot more rational thinking without an inherent prior bias. Even to the point where he states something that is so obvious: In America, you can criticize those in power for their decisions (which Stone loves to do) but in Putin's Russia, you might very well not see the light of another day if you do so. 
Of course, Oliver could never come to his conclusion (that people in the West have the freedom to speak their mind, even when it comes to their own government) because it would undermine a tremendous aspect of his self-perception: That he's one of the few American filmmakers to continually criticize his countries government and this fact alone makes whatever he creates so much more special than the work of other US filmmakers. It is his brand. But hey. Anyone can do it. But most filmmakers just find it too boring and a senseless exercise. 
On the other hand, Kotkin really strings it out in a way that is logical, makes sense, seems to track incredibly well with historical document. He's not a filmmaker. He a political analyst. 
Stone is just a filmmaker and has done his better work in fiction... embellishing and shaping his very personal take on historical moments. Fine ... but, in this particular instance, I prefer to listen to someone who clearly understands the narrative as it has played out and doesn't just want to bash the part of the US government in the last 40+ years relating to Russia. 
Heck, I am originally German, have worked in Russia on several occasions and still have some contacts there. I never perceive that the Russians I had contact with were fans of Putin, they just endured the fact that they lived under a dictator as long as they could go about their business of working in the film industry. 
That's all gone now and many are leaving the country. Putin is trying to ""make Russia great again"" and drag it back 40+ years into the past. As Trump tried with the US. 
I am happy to see that they are both failing and I hope it stays this way. 
My best wishes go out to the Ukrainian people, they are fighting a war that is for all of Europe, and I think that is being realized, along with the resulting food crisis. 
So, thumbs-up to Kotkin's clear view of the world as it unfolds and a thumbs-down for Stone who can't seem to crawl out of the foxhole from which he chooses to commentate as long as he can criticize the US establishment."
1085,"Lex, I have one big ask; bring on Alexander Dugin. Please do the entire interview in Russian and subtitle it."
1086,"Life is a game like scissors, paper, stone.  Except that the rules can be changed.  You still need to be lucky to win, so go make your luck as quickly as possible.
Very interesting after STONE.  Thanks very much for accessing a completely articulate realist.  Great guy."
1087,YESSS!!! Round 1 is one of my favorite interviews you‚Äôve done and probably overall!! So excited to to watch this!!
1088,That rape analogy was desperate and pathetic
1089,"Lex, I love how you're giving so much different perspective on these topics. You are doing a great service. Thank you."
1090,This guy is so slimy and intellectually dishonest.
1091,We do not live in a Democracy. We live in a Constitutional Republic. That is all thank you.
1092,I get the sense that Mr Kotkin is an excellent scholar. Thanks to Mr Fridman for getting an interview with him.
1093,Literally the best one yet!
1094,"Great pod, Lex. Kotkin""s clear-eyed analysis is spot on. The truth hurts sometimes, as you can tell from all the Russian propaganda here in the comments. Keep up the great work."
1095,Nice to hear Mr Kotkin explain all the variables(bureaucrats) in the Putin government that aren't obvious. About the resolve of the West. And why Putin can afford to wait since he has already collapsed the Ukrainian economy and has already made territorial net gains.  We have yet to see how the Western Heavy Weapons are going to help the Ukrainians.
1096,Only 30 minutes in and I'm kinda thinking whats the point of finishing.  This guy is clearly a true believer in the mandate of America exceptionalism to spread its ideology across the world backed by military might which I find even more reprehensible than the naked and unapologetic versions of the same strategy found in the East.
1097,"Great conversation. Was personally outraged by the one with Oliver Stone, found that repugnant"
1098,The excellent timing of this interview as the geopolitical and economical world is entering a very dangerous and difficult period ahead. Let us hope that the Worlds leaders have studied history and will not commit past mistakes that dragged humanity to two devastating World wars. I hope that Oliver Stone watched this interview with Steven Kotkin. God Bless Lex 
1099,"Hey Lex, its such a joy to see videos from your channel this regularly. Keep it Active. 
Go, Go Lex Ô∏è"
1100,We need this guy to debate Oliver Stone
1101,Absolutely fantastic discussion. I started listening here on youtube and finished streaming on Spotify on the back porch with a whiskey in hand. Stephen Kotkin is a wonderful conversationalist with calm and reason. I didn't agree with everything Oliver Stone said but equally enjoyed that conversation. Keep up the good work Lex. Your discussions have purpose and are important.
1102,The interview was good however his analogy of a woman getting raped is an extremely poor one. I don't think it applies at all. Ukraine isn't/wasn't this completely innocent little country that Russia just decided to invade without any reason or warning whatsoever.
1103,Thank you again Lex. Love this interview.
1104,What nonsense. Ridiculous analogies and no understanding of Russian military strategy. Also naive.
1105,"Yes!! Been listening to the first episode with Kotkin 10-15 times, he is just too good!"
1106,"Don‚Äôt go Lex we need your voice not in prison. But I know you will go, for the blood of both runs through you. So my prayers go with you on this mission of love. So many prayers go with you."
1107,"Best Episode yet, Lex"
1108,"I agree with Putin's reasoning for invading Ukraine, If NATO was closing in on my borders I would have attacked as well. I also believe in freedom over non-freedom. Freedom is giving me the ability to say things I want to say on this platform. So it's hard to say who is the greater evil in this situation. But I can say that the West is no saint at all!!"
1109,"Stay safe Lex, the world really needs people like you who speak to the importance of love and understanding. Looking forward to your return, and to hearing about your experiences in Russia and Ukraine."
1110,"Stephen Kotkin is a refreshing academic's view of geopolitics, from the Oliver Stone's deliberately controversial point of view."
1111,thank you for having stephen kotkin on again. I listened to his last podcast after the war started and really wanted to know his thoughts now.
1112,Lex should interview Piero Scaruffi. Great podcast!!
1113,"This interview was so necessary after Oliver Stone. Thanks Lex, you are making a difference in many people‚Äôs lives."
1114,Cf the murder or Oles Buzina
1115,Just finished listening to it on over on spotify. I Just wanted to comment on how excellent this conversation was. Great job as usual Lex 
1116,i did not enjoy oliver stone episode and did not enjoy this one as well. ignorant and one-sided(not about being sided againts russian aggression but the hypocretic policy that westerns re following cuz i m also supporting ukraine.)
1117,It‚Äòs so sweet how Kotkin playfully closes his eyes Ô∏è
1118,"Lex, this is without a doubt, your most interesting guest to date. Greetings from South Africa. Our government may claim neutrality in the Ukraine invasion but the thinking populace see it for what it is.  Please keep up the excellent work you are doing and visit us soon."
1119,"I find people strange who say your name every sentence Lex.

Right Lex?

What do you think Lex?

"
1120,One of my favourite interviews you did‚Ä¶  Kotkin is so crystal clear and explains exactly how it is.
1121,"Oh good, there are several of these. This is the first I heard Stephen Kotkin and it is compressed quality. Appreciation."
1122,"I didn't liked what Olver Stone said, but I got his point of view. You are one of my favorite youtubers, and I don't have many. What you are doing is widening our toughts, Thank You! I saw how hard it was for you to talk about this subject"
1123,"Wow, who knew Joe Pesci was so knowledgeable about Russian history!"
1124,So this guy is smart ay .
1125,"44:50 ""nato is a defensive alliance"".  What about when that ""defensive alliance"" bombed an independent Yugoslavia in 1999?"
1126,Lex literally facilitates creation of more valuable content than some other mainstream huge human organizations. If Ukraine series continues next guest should be from the other side.
1127,Easily among the Top 10 YT chans of the 2020s. Also: Paul Stamets is a treasure chest - please tap him!! Rogan can vouch & so can their last pod together.
1128,"Maybe a I'm nitpicking, but I hate how he keeps saying Lex' name. Seems very manipulative
Overal it's  a great conversation though (at 1 hour in)"
1129,"Would be amazing if you could get Richard Evans on the podcast - an amazing historian and intellectual, who in my opinion is one of the most analytical and unbiased intellectuals out there"
1130,Ok this guy seems really smart but isn't this exactly what Trump had kept in check?  ??
1131,"Scott Horton must get on the Lex Fridman Podcast. I love Stephen Kotkin and have listened to him for years, but I would be really interested to see how he responds to being challenged on the moral superiority of the west in geo politics Bc from what I can tell, his bias is very much towards the West."
1132,"""I love you all""
Aww.
So do we Lex.xÔ∏èÔ∏è
Tu es une personne merveilleuse et je suis certain que ton p√®re est fier de toi 
Prends soin de toi et de tes proches. Nous vivons des moments difficiles, h√©r√©tiques, mais ton travail, le mien, et de toutes les bonnes √¢mes qui nous entourent changeront la face de notre maison √† tous... Et qui, je souhaite, ne sera plus √† vendre,
L'IA peut nous aider, √† optimiser les r√©partitions tout en r√©duisant les conflits.

Azimov was a wize man 

Over"
1133,"This is the second time that I hear the great knock-out Kotkin mention Gandhi once in a lecture, out of the blue, and now in an interview, nobody forcing it upon him neither-, with kinda of a slightly and rapidly supressed admiration. I would be most grateful to you, Mr. Fridman, if on a third round with Stephen Kotkin -please don't let him long of the hook, who else do we have to turn to for insight in this seemingly cursed epoch?-, you could see fit to ask kim about Gandhi and non-violence as a national ""security policy"" in a geopolitical context populated with the national-grandeur-womanising ""leaders"" of sorts you happened to dwell upon in this podcast. Somewhere i feel Mr.Kotkin thinks well of Gandhi as an alternative nationbuilder even if he could not build an alternative nation at all in the always final realist end. He seemed to have stood for nothing Kotkin argues at length (in other videos on the tube) to deem necessary to create a nation that could acquire a free influence sphere, i.e. all the multiple powers America makes Russia so envious about, all the heavy hardware stuff, besides the values that is. Gandhi wanted nothing of that for modern India, and apart from the very profound Swadeshi-economy-ideal the spinningwheel and its kadhi stood for as a multivalent symbol, he appeared to barely tolerate steamtrains beside the much admired Singer sowing machine. And I think he would have had nothing to do with nowaday things that are called Stinger (missiles etc), not even considering the longrun national security interest of India. Nehru did not follow him in that, and could not make do with Gandhis wisdom after the British rolled out and he had to fight-modernise wholesale for India's place in the sun among the non-aligned countries pressed hard between the two cold-war blocks. So what is non-violence as an integral spiritual political nation building program (and not just a possibly useful -given that the British were after all, all in all good sports decolonisation strategy) worth in Stephen Kotkin well armed prudential world...? Gandhi was definitely thinking about economy, peace, ecology, sustainability avant-la-lettre in all their interactions and all kinds of important public issues we face and he was in no way a mere fakir in a loincloth (Churchill) pulling some uncanny tricks on the white man. So what was he, and what might he still be now in our age for Kotkin's penetrating gaze? I close my eyes and I can hear Kotkin come up with a resignated ""Ah Gandhi, shame that...""-statement. 
Could the new whole of a world grounded in wisdom old as the mountains Gandhi always stood for and realistically pretended India to follow him along in, and which he did not get from his follower-devotional-Bapudhji callers, could this integral Gandhi for some realistic but in its reasonableness unsuspected consideration on the part of Kotkin not have induced this, his ""shame that""- kinda statement I think I hear from his lips? I would like a man that can measure a perduring abyss (Stalin), have measure the durableness of a mountain like the Mahatma...
Thank you most gratefully for your very considerate work and God bless. Many wellwishing greetings to you from Nazareth, Belgium."
1134,"11min mark. Stalin didn't value an individual life. Really? Thats the leading thought about a dude who read every individuals name before and after they died... and many died trying to fulfill that simple yet very difficult task. Deluding himself... yuk. Cannot listen to much more. ... he more than any other will bring the Stalin prophecy  into a reality faster than it should. 
When Stalin is eulogised. The end is nigh. 
With his complete mis representations. That can be the only outcome.
He leaves out so many central parts/facets its hard to believe anything he comes up with.
Was taught if your critical you better offer something tangible. Stalin was Rothschild bag man in the Baku oilfields. When Trotsky turned up with Rockerfella gold, Stalin maintained his composure as the best money man the Revolution required. And its quite simple to deduct that a natural response to why are internationals dealing so shady with us. That you would believe that subjugation is a part of that. So his entire thesis from the 15m to 22m mark is so far from the realities. That kotkin can only be one thing. A paid charlatan who believes his own lies. And he knows he is doing it. Why else is it so hard to prize the next volume out of him...and on que. The cold War bs again."
1135,I've never seen such a poetic and  rhetorical tour de force from Kotkin.
1136,The truth was in Oliver Stone's interview.
1137,Definitely take his opinions over Stone‚Ä¶thanks Lex for guests who have many different perspectives
1138,Great video   Thank you... Lex
1139,"NATO doesn't attack? Tell that to former Yugoslavia, millions of dead in Iraq & the destruction of Lybia. I respect getting the other view but so many holes in Stephen's point of view."
1140,Stephen speaking out of my heart once again.
1141,I‚Äôd love you to interview an RF or microwave engineer
1142,Haha this guy doesn‚Äôt understand Russia or Russians at all.
1143,Would be amazing if he could have interview with Julian Assange!
1144,"No disrespect, but l feel that all the ambiguity and diversity Kotkin is allotted has gone to the timbre of his voice - try to determine is it a man or a woman speaking without seeing him. 

In words and reasoning he is so obviously and rigidly subscribed to a certain narrative it makes everything he says very predictable. 

Being a historian is not about committing to some point of view and building upon it with with selected facts and factoids while totally ignoring everything that doesn't fit the seemingly solid edifice."
1145,"37:55

""Sovereign countries get to choose whatever alliances they want to...""

Except when it comes to America and countries around it.
Cuba can have Soviet missiles ?"
1146,You handled this podcast very well Lex! 
1147,"Yes, you should go and visit those countries, see with your own eyes, hear the screams from both sides, review all conditions of each deal presented to both sides, meet all people involved and talk to them, and bring us back your aspect of the truth without fear of censorship. I'll believe you because you have a big heart."
1148,Will watch again
1149,You know I think Joe Pesci is onto something here. Really insightful
1150,I guess that historian guest only studied Hollywood stories about Russia...  
1151,Wow kotkin lost me on the rape metaphor. That's classic pseudointellectualism.
1152,"Respect for Stephen Kotkin, very sober and clear view of Russia"
1153,"I listened to Kotkin and am glad I did, but I see him as an ivory tower pawn touting Western exceptionalism with an exclusively Western lens.

His stance that NATO is purely defensive is weak and his assertion that the whole world is Western because of institutional leadership is more flawed ever day. 

I bet he wears Skechers to the Hermitage. 

Negotiate, end the fighting."
1154,This is going to give Mr. Stone a heart-attack.
1155,Wow this is incredible!
1156,No you write history but your understanding of Russian soul is not sufficient
1157,This was the exact opposite feeling listening to Kotkin vs. the 2 hrs of frustration I felt having to listen to Stone and not being able to respond to his intentional half truths.
1158,The most cohesive and in depth explanation of Russia and Ukraine I've heard. A brilliant and articulate scholar.
1159,Oliver Stone made more sense to me
1160,Most fascinating discussion. I love Stephen Kotkin amd Lex brings out the best in him.
1161,"Kotkin is great but at the end of the day he‚Äôs a statist and will look down on those who are anti-interventionism. They think it‚Äôs impossible to hate communism, but have no desire to go to or support war.

His ballwashing of the Fed and central banks is pretty funny. Their policies are destroying our currencies but we‚Äôre still the envy of the world‚Ä¶.for now lol"
1162,"Jesus, what‚Äôs with all the deep sighs? Have a coke, or a coffee, or something, and get in the game, ffs."
1163,"Stephen Kotkin, brilliant man!"
1164,Get Mearsheimer!
1165,"He touches on a lot of historical facts ,however we truly don't know the truth about this so-called television production of this War which can be manipulated too easily, especially since we have been lied to over the last 5 wars concerning the US..Thank you for bringing this information forward for all to review, Outstanding ..!"
1166,"As far as I know, we are all living on a globe. It seems rather silly to define a ""west"" as opposed to an ""east"", while living on a globe. At least if you are interested in making factual statements. If you are interested in making political statements, it becomes a different matter. It that case you can call things whatever suits your political interests.

I would have been interested in hearing factual statements from a esteemed historian like mister Kotkin. However I am not interested in hearing political statements from mister Kotkin. So I stopped after about 10 minutes.

Have a wonderful journey to your beloved lands Lex."
1167,"Suggest Fiona Hill, former NSC staffer, as an interview. She has a lot of up-close and personal with Putin and understands his connection with Russian (and Ukrainian) history."
1168,What a Polemist
1169,lol I almost daily watch out for a kotkin upload on youtube but there hasnt been one recently. good job lexi. Please also get peter zeihan on these two are amazin
1170,Who knew Joe Pesci is so into Russian issues.
1171,I'm not feelin this guest like all the rest of you fanboys. Just me I guess. He seems like a NATO  apologist to me.
1172,Great intro my manüá¨üáß
1173,"As above, so below; hunter gatherer alpha based on the ability to forge alliance s still today. Wonderful interview, I feel more centered, heartened."
1174,"Everything is the West' fault, sounds pretty lefty to me ^^"
1175,"This is precisely the balance that was needed after the Oliver Stone interview. Thank you, Lex."
1176,Hey Lexus 
1177,"lost me @ 37:00

nonsense!"
1178,"""Your salad is screaming in pain"" instantly made me think that's lex's russian romance coming out  love it 

Joe Rogan Podcast on Spotify can't comment on there so yea "
1179,i feel kotkin is making a lot of this stuff up... not really using real-life examples or hard facts like dates or historical examples
1180,"Thank you Lex and Steven Kotkin.
Amazing and insightful conversation."
1181,"@lex fridman,  really enjoyed the podcast. Have short question though. What the pain of russian  people are you talking about?  Could you please clarify on that?"
1182,"And this all details the difference between the Ukrainians and the Afghans.   The Ukrainians are willing to fight for their freedom and the Afghans aren't. Why?  Religious fervour.   And this is where the west misunderstood Afghanistan.  Their religion rules over everything else.  Democracy, education, wealth, freedom, prosperity takes a back seat.  The people in Afghanistan have been brainwashed for hundreds and hundreds of years by their religion and it isn't modernizing or evolving in any substantive way.  I just don't see any country that is so dominated by their beliefs this way to be able to develop a modern democracy.  It just was a terrible mistake going into Afghanistan thinking westerners could help move this backward place toward science, democracy, and freedom unless they stayed for hundreds of years."
1183,I've come to realize that it doesn't matter what field your guest is in. Every human being has the potential to be fascinating
1184,What a fetid pile of lies and vulgar propaganda! Cheap and revolting.
1185,"I hope he would speak to the affect on Russia of living just above, north of, the Middle East while the West waged war in Yemen, through Saudi Arabia, Iraq, carpet bombing them, more than half of them children, now a failed state, Iran‚Äôs ultimate nuclear treaty break, failed 20 year war in Afghanistan after that illegal invasion and the devastation that‚Äôs caused to those ppl‚Äôs, the death of Gaddafi in Libya, now a failed state‚Ä¶ given their Geopolitical location to these countries and the US‚Äôs military budget, I wonder if these last twenty years of devastation in these countries just to the south of them as had any affect on their thinking and actions in Ukraine and the rest of the World?"
1186,"Hey Lex - just shot you a couple of emails and applied for a Video Editor position. If for whatever reason those 3 attempts to get on your radar didn't work, I hope this one does!"
1187,"Lex, I have enjoyed MR Kotkin and his views. What I was wondering about is, Is there any  wisdom in you searching for the early days of The Bolshevik revolution. I heard that originally it was called the ""Great sharing"". Is this true ?. The totalitarian phase seems to always be the focus. Was it ever a pure pursuit  of the revolutionaries or  was it always just a sales pitch by the power hungry? Trotsky seems to be a character in the pursuit of  the sharing aspect.. Could you have Mr Kotkin or another historian on to research this era."
1188,Yeah F oliver stone!
1189,Have kotkin on more=I will watch more.
1190,Did Nato attack  Afghanistan?
1191,"A friend said once, ""there's a saying back in Serbia that the Americans will fight Russia down to the last Ukrainian."""
1192,"Thank you, Stephen, for bringing up the stiff resistance to the Nazi occupation of Ukraine. My father was one of those partisans fighting the Nazis as a 16-year old boy, captured and sent to concentration camp, freed by American troops."
1193,This is a great interview!  Why do we refer to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs yet people that buy elections to control Congress in the United States are just called just rich people doing business? We have our own corruption problem and the techno military industry is only looking out for their bottom line while they' wrap themselves in the American flag. even Jimmy Carter states that we do not live in a functioning democracy. Perhaps this is not so much test of ideals but rather decision between styles of oligarchy and power
1194,end of petro dollar. enuff said.
1195,Thanks you for this excellent content Lex. Professor Kotkin wonderful as usual.
1196,"Unfortunately you can't explain that situation with a rape. Sorry. Geopolitics work and should work differently. Both, all three parties were not playing with open cards. We have to lear from the mistakes. If we don't even recognise them we would not learn from them. He is wrong on Russian aggression. What about Great Britain, the USA???"
1197,This is brilliant and nuanced.  Taken with the inward looking Oliver Stone interview we are treated to the full complexity of the conflict
1198,We love u Lex!  Plz b careful!  Come back to us safely!
1199,What a heartfelt intro Lex. We love you too.
1200,"This video makes me think that Putin is like Raskolnikov in Crime and Punishment, where murder changes a person, especially if they keep getting away with it."
1201,Very eloquent and well spoken though i worry Kotkin's a neocon
1202,"Dear friends, I am speechless, and grateful to Stephen and Lex. I have gained again faith in humanity.
I still hope that the world will be a better place for all of us, no matter where we live and what we believe.
God bless you all,
Rovinj, Croatia"
1203,"The first ten minutes, that's all it took. The most damning critique of Putin's choice you will ever hear."
1204,Did anyone else find his means of delivering a point through repetition really annoying?
1205,"Thank you lex for introducing Stephen to me and for another great episode. I was just thinking about the amount of respect he displayed for you throughout the podcast and you mentioning it at the end just makes me appreciate who you are even more. Love from Romania!
PS: If you need a place to stay before reaching Ukraine/Russia, I would be more than glad to host you in Bucharest."
1206,I think it'd be great if this gentleman would come back and talked about China.
1207,"I am sure Lex must have noticed the high frequency of his first name being used by Mr. Kotkin at certain moments. These ""Lex""es mark the most  interesting parts of the interview and correlate with certain kind of statements."
1208,"This man should have 1.9m views, not ""everything is the west's fault"" Oliver Stone."
1209,"I was expecting at least a small mentioning of UPA and the Bandera cult (then and now) but after listening to the whole podcast it became clear why it couldn't be the case. I guess I was naive and took the title ""historian"" too seriously."
1210,"Oh,Nato doesnt attack, only defends...it is very nice tu forgot what is not convinient. Kosovo, attacking Serbia by Nato, 1999. This is the main reason why this is happening today"
1211,"As always, thanks, Lex; Love and admiration, friend."
1212,"Lex, dear, dear LEX!
PLEASE do not visit Russia right now!  I have become attached to your wonderful heart and mind. As most everyone else here has also. I do not want you to risk your freedom, your health and mental well being. You're needed here.  Please stay safe. We can't afford to lose you!"
1213,Very informative episode. Stephen Kotkin makes his arguments very clear. Thank you
1214,Stephen Kotkin - he believes this propaganda?
1215,Putin's most expensive possession is apparently his ego and the impossible aspirations it leads to. Yet he also whines being outcompeted in a game of carrot and the stick. Maybe Ukraine would have responded better to a carrot than the stick.
1216,"Belittling Russian belief in their greatness  and love for their culture, asserting manipulation for misbehavior without reckoning? What about US moist eyes and decimating indians, invading dozens of countries, fomenting revolutions, taking over assets ? Each country speaks of defending freedoms and 25 mm  Russians died to destroy the majority of the German army. Yes US helped defeat Germany, each country shd be both recognized and critiqued.  Who have been  punished for the over 1.5 mm who have died in US wars in Mideast in Iraq with  lie about wmd and Al Qaeda, in wars vs, Libya, Afghanistan, Libya , Yemen, etc.. western intellectuals, every supposed analyst shd do an honest  comparison as they get their audiences' eyes wet as they choose to forget Assange, or Snowden, or the many fake pretexts for war . Americans can have tears and beliefs... How do their net sufferings due to injustice and price paid to defend their way of life compare with those of other  nations? Why is Cuba an issue but a simple non participation by Ukraine a non issue? The accusations vs Russia are all w real basis?  Aa The CiA conspiracy theories hav no strong basis  historically? Is this guy really covering the scope of his subject? Yes there were mutual corruptions, liesz etc..  but to pooh pooh the concerns of other countries, Lex, u shd it interview real knowledgeable scholars who are also actual practitioners in dealing w the US, that answer these ridiculing remarks this guy spreads so liberally. uS is the country that considers all rules dont apply to itself while lecturing and invading others. not ICC, UNCLos, UN resolutions, etc.. do study the different wars and revolutions in the last 50 years ?"
1217,"I started listening to these podcasts in addition to my AI interest. But Lex, this has become so much more. 

You became aware of your range and influence. Most people today seem to maximize popularity and money afterwards, but you seem to understand that this kind of power is so much more. You really seem to be focusing on education and spreading knowledge, even though going into political issues can and will cause issues to you as a person.

Iam so proud of you taking this step. Some said the Stone interview was one sided and you are countering this argument by giving an alternative view within a week. 
You are really a scientific person and a great educator. Please stay safe, i want to have many more years with your content <3"
1218,This is an excellent history and set the scene for understanding the rights and wrongs of the present war.
1219,Excited to see he's on again!
1220,Thank you Lex for supporting Russia in this war!
1221,I think the US should send Lex to talk to Putin. He could get through his list of grievances and find his humanity.
1222,Askhenazi Jew asks and other  you will never get the truth from here but can dive into their lies.
1223,"I appreciate the diverse perspectives, much to add to my understanding of diverse positions on this subject.  With that being said, it appears that this scholar conveniently leaves aspects out of his perspective.  He employs imperialism.of historical Russia and not enough if at all any of the imperialism of the west especially how it's made through financial institutions."
1224,This guy is ignorant on this subject.
1225,Mr. Kotkin is a treasure. His recent talks with Peter Robinson on the Hoover Institute's Uncommon Knowledge podcast are brilliant.
1226,I feel so stupid when i listen to Lex's podcast... brilliant host and brilliant guest. Thank you and please continue to make me feel stupid.
1227,"Often those trained by academia don‚Äôt know how to dialogue well.

They‚Äôre too used to just giving their opinions with a mic up front."

1231,Whoa. That intro was heavy. Best wishes on the travelling Lex
1232,"For me this was a breath of fresh perspective, after suffering through Oliver Stone‚Äôs opinion."

1236,Thank YouSLAVA  UKRAINIGLORY UKRAINIANPEOPLE = HEROESYESYESYESPALDIES
1237,I love the clear analysis of Kotkin‚Ä¶
1238,Kotkin coming soon with his volumes on Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin! I wonder how much he makes with his book royalties! May be he should write few volumes on Late Saddam Hussain and Gaddafi! His insights would be highly appreciated! Pity he is a Russian specialist! It‚Äôs leave so much lacuna in our understanding of the Middle East!
1239,"Lex, you are my hero. And I never thought I would ever have one, thank you so much. Love you"

1242,"Love your work, Mr. Fridman.  Can you please interview, ""Peter Zeihan""?"
1243,Kotkin oratory is one of a master.
1244,I have only started following you in the past two weeks. very very insightful. please be careful if you go to Russia or Ukraine.
1245,"What an amazing talk, I've learned a lot with you both, thank you Lex and Stephen!"
1246,"I didn't like the early tension from Stephen. When he was always repeating your name and using the tense as if you, lex, were the problem. But it got a lot better later on. This was very interesting. It seems Russia has a beta complex, of being weaker than the west but desire to be better. It shows. I had 2 dogs who would fight. Gizmo would bark and bark at batman. Batman was calm until Gizmo made a move and Batman would put him in his place. I think this dynamic is playing out between The West and Russia currently."
1247,27:38 powerful
1248,"Is he Joe Pesci's cousin? Joke aside, great conversation as always"
1249,the differential in views between this one and the oliver stone one is a problem
1250,Monumental interview.
1251,"Dear Lex, 
You're podcast has been such wonderful journey. I think about everything I have learned from the conversations you have had with so many wonderful and informative guests you've had on your podcast and I feel so  grateful for that. You have a lot of us that support you and will continue to support you and your endeavors. Thank you for the service you provide to us by having such an informative, neutral, and non-biased podcast, thank you for asking important, hard and correct questions. We all wish you well and we all wish you a safe journey to both Ukraine and Russia. Please come back to us safely!"
1252,"Lol lex got hit on the head serious.
:( I appreciate his podcasts though. Great guests on the show just laughable commentary from the host."
1253,"Some people want to understand things clearly. The Players in the USA know who Putin is. They know the history. These are the games influential Players play. If you have no power, you are a resource for those with power."
1254,Thank you for sharing!
1255,Russia doesn‚Äôt allow the federal reserve to have their banking system in their country 
1256,"Take a shot every time Kotkin says ""Lex""."
1257,so glad you followed Stone with Kotkin
1258,"Dear Lex, please thank your guest for convincing me, with his dodgy self serving arguments which insult the intelligence of your audience, that it is Oliver Stone and John Mearshheimer that are unquestionably right not him ‚Ä¶"
1259,"In this episode, Lex hears his name called more than it has in his entire life"
1260,"Honest Q. Accepting Ukraine corruption, is it okay for American(Democracy) political oligarchy to cooperate with Ukraine for financial gains? Pre and post Russian invasion"
1261,"Such a condescending guy, that Kotkin. ‚ÄúYou cool with that Lex? You cool with that?‚Äù 
I could feel Lex‚Äôs wrath building. He choked a bear after the podcast."
1262,He is the best! Real expert.
1263,Great interview but this guy is very opinionated especially for a historian. he seems to be particularly opinionated and dismissive of other perspectives.
1264,37:20  Kotkin Savage 3X OG no cap! 
1265,"Lex, you told us some time ago that you needed time and thought to decide how to approach this very difficult subject and particularly so regarding your own background. I have never heard of Stephen Kotkin before now and can safely say that I am floored by his knowledge and mastery of description and his obvious likeability. 

Your carefully spaced and thoughtful questions and the large uninterrupted space that you give this man to speak is unique and badly needed right now. There are so many informed and not so informed opinions available right now on the war that it has become an information blizzard. This man cuts right through it all with a knowledge , humanity and wisdom that gives hope and at the same time sounds a warning that we do not really know where it is going other than to say that evolution got us this far and surely we can overcome this. 

Your podcast is unmatched and curious minds drink it in!"
1266,"English is not only the international relations communication and information transfer medium. English is the basis of all programming languages, technology frameworks, tools and supporting resources that undergird the information technology future"
1267,"Dude, let me know if you need some assistance. I'm an American Infantry NCO who was raised and born in Ukraine and just got back from there. I know the country  upside down, speak both languages,  and I can help you with logistics and transportation on the ground through my contacts on both sides of the border. I also just like you work on the Documentary about this conflict, because me and my family was shocked in to it. I'll provide you with some valuable information even if you decide to travel with or without me."
1268,Super Super interview thank you
1269,"Lex, you are amazing in producing interesting perspective on complex issues. Mr Stephen has interesting and has strong views ,though not based on historical grounding on the UKraine issue as such. The opinion appeared like a US official pep talk on current war.  On war crimes , not so long ago , ICC was threatened by the same powerful institutionalised nation for arrest if cases against their soldiers were put to trial. Overall still interesting to hear . War is inhuman. This war is transforming slowly into a NATO versus Russsia & eventually the scale of destruction both actual and potential will force all nations of the world to take side, & that's WWIII.A solvable complex problem turned into a non sensical ELT .   Mr Putin may reach Zugzwang soon once offensive weapons are in play."
1270,"I am a simple man, i see Kotkin and i listen and upvote"
1271,37:19 Lex realizing the video is going to get demonetized
1272,What Kotkin is doing on this show is pure one sided prop
1273,Any woman should have the right to apply for NATO membership
1274,I don‚Äôt know who Started this war in the first place but we got to beat the invaders üá∫üá¶
1275,Such a pleasure to listen to Stephen in this forum.
1276,"Hey lex, have you heard of Gregg Braden? I think he would be an interesting guest"
1277,I was waiting for this
1278,"Lex, why not invite the historian Andrew Roberts to talk about Napoleon and Churchill?"
1279,"Possibly one of the best conversations have seen in the past months.
I admire Lex Fridman going to travel. 
The answer of Steven Kotkin to Oliver Stone, Wrong Skirt and Lipstick (min 36:00 ff). And the ability to make corrections. The favourite trade (min 48:00). 
""The Ukrainian Resistance (courage and ingenuity) to the Russians is one of the greatest gifts the West has ever received."" 1:06:00
Re expenses of Ukraine 1:32:00, wouldn't it be possible to put an international tax on all Russian (energy) products? If the Russian products don't go out of business still there is the money. For poor countries like India other countries could pay this tax. 
Currently ongoing watching."
1280,"Lex....cheer up, mate ! "
1281,"Appreciate Kotkin's deep knowledge of history, however, not having any experiential knowledge of what it's like to be in a war or to have family living under a totalitarian regime who pray daily for death so their nightmare of a life will finally end is lost on him. It's like someone who's never tasted a food, but has extensive theoretical knowledge of it, describing it; in reality, he doesn't know."
1282,Stephen Kotkin 
1283,The human rights standards between East and West is the obvious metric to which those who relentlessly criticise the West from within the West generally avoid.
1284,Are u gonna be uploading from your homeland or do interviews even in the native language with subtitles
1285,"You are an amazing human being Lex, brave, smart, wise, but your kindness is what most of all I admire! "
1286,Holy shit!   Please be safe Lex!
1287,"Lex has really become a dymamic pod caster, not having a need to interject his personal ego allows for his guests to be actually heard, unlike  mainstream media. Well done. This contributor however only resulted in reinforcing my stance, that is to see Russia retain its geo political strength (though I'm not optimistic) in order to provide some, if little, repluse to the US and indeed now the EU expansionism."
1288,navalny 2nd most powerful man in russia man got less than 5% in the recent election
1289,"I would not call S. Kotkin as a greatest historian of all times, just another historian with interest in past leadership of USSR and the rest transpires down in below comments."
1290,I will purchase the three volumes.  I now need to know.
1291,"Greece should charge money every time west use word ""democracy""."
1292,"While I do not agree with Mr. Kotkin in most aspects of his views, as he seems biased and letting that bias overrule facts and deeper reasons, it still is an interesting conversation.

Sorry, correction - 15 minutes in and out. Enough ""delusions"". Everyone can have his own opinions but others don't need to listen to them. I don't want to hear my own thoughts in an echo chamber but I also don't want to listen to pseudo-intellectual propaganda. And certainly not of the typical kind of the pre-revolutionary Russian diaspora in the West who have been out of touch with Russia for the last 50+ years. Still, thank you for bringing Mr. Kotkin on."
1293,"Friends, watch the International Forum that was held on May 7, 2022. The Global Crisis WE ARE PEOPLE WANT TO LIVE. It voiced the most important topics affecting all humanity. It is very important! Only together we can overcome it! This unique forum with participants from 180 countries translated into 100 languages was organized by volunteers from all over the world!"
1294,most important interview of 2022
1295,"As a counterpoint to the Stone interview I think it's clear who is more neutral, thoughtful, and peace-loving.  The comparison to ""provocative dress -> rape"" is ridiculous and off-side.  If you haven't already go listen to an interview with someone who cares about real people, not fantasy ""good guy bad guy""."
1296,2:50 lol Lex why did you just crack up man?
1297,"Huge fan but I suspect I will jot agree with his interpretation of what is going on, but we shall see."
1298,"Quite a Jeremiad.  Carthago delenda est!  The subject really does look ugly until look at the others in the room.  Would the litany be as intense if the US or Israel's rap sheet was being read out to the crowd?  Or, are these so exceptional they get a free pass?
Kotkin mentions, as an example, the 1948 Soviet coup against democratic Czechoslovakia.  ""Are you okay with that!?""  He doesn't mention the US intervention in Italy's elections that same year.  Nor the overthrow of democratic Syria, the next:  A coup that started the crisis Syria has been in ever since.  ""We are okay with that.""  Nor the coup against democratic Iran a couple of year later, which ended hope in that country and started it on its tragic slide.  Czechoslovakia, by comparison, got off easy.
He says that fact that we can talk about our crimes in coffee shops without getting arrested shows that we are better and more liberal societies.  An yet, none of our criminals have been prosecuted.  Our nations have not faced any consequence.  Of the three, it is only Russia that has had to pay any price for its actions.  Only Russia has been repeatedly sanctioned, boycotted, and de-platformed.  Only Russia has had its citizens banned and harrassed, their property seized, and their contracts cancelled.  When did the US or Israel ever experience any justice like that?
He calls NATO a defensive alliance.  But since 1990, with Yugoslavia, it has involved itself in one military intervention after another.  Interventions that have grown increasingly aggressive because of something he ascribes to Putin:  Learned impunity.  And yet, it is Russia that must be made an example and held accountable -- even to the point of the destruction and subjugation of their nation.  No punishment is too harsh.  Carthage must be destroyed!
Finally, he lays out, with approval, the prospect of Israel attacking Iran because Iran might get nuclear weapons which might pose a threat to Israel.  He doesn't realize that he is describing the next Ukraine.  A nation engaging in activities which are wholly within its sovereign rights but which are nevertheless perceived to be a possible threat to a neighbor.  This time a ""neighbor"" 1000 miles away.  Compare this to Russia, which, rightly or wrongly, is intervening right next door.  In lands populated by consanguines who were being persecuted and killed -- not in error, but as a matter of policy -- by the government in Kiev.
At this point, whether Russia was right or wrong to invade Ukraine is irrelevant.  What should concern us is the crime of intensifying and prolonging a conflict that should have already ended.  The war is being perpetuated for the vainglory of Zelenskyy, his party, and their cynical supporters in the West -- none of whose motives are not honorable.  It does the Ukrainian people and their nation no good -- either in the short term or the long term.  Only peace can do that.  It is the present and future that we should be concerned about -- and the future that we should be seeking to preserve."
1299,Interesting to contrast with Stone.
1300,This is the most lucid and coherent exposition of the current world geopolitics and the Russian invasion I have ever seen.
1301,"I have to disagree with Kotkin. Basically he said the west is good and right.
And others opposing the west are wrong, the bad guys. Very one sided opinion !!!"
1302,Navalny as a prime Minister?! 
1303,"Lex, please invite MICHAEL LEVIN, a biology professor from Tufts. He is doing some of the most interesting and provocative work in evolutionary biology today (collective intelligence, sub-cellular intelligence, non DNA biological controls, etc.)"
1304,The Joe Pesci of historians
1305,Thanks!
1306,Regarding signing documents. One could argue that none of them are legitimate since they went against the will of people in 1991 referendum.
1307,"1:26:35
Whenever someone asks on the Internet what is driving Putin's mind, he always offers a lot of bad assumptions about him from which to choose. It is clear from the tone that the respondent can say something of his own and quite original, but the negative tone is set in advance around the world.
Perhaps by attacking Ukraine, Putin prevented a third world war that would happen in 10 to 15 years.
Such a development is inconceivable to the current set of Western politicians, and it is difficult for them to predict that politicians who would try to threaten Russia would be different from them. The Russians have to think more realist because after all, it‚Äôs about them. It is also possible that there would have been wars within the Europe that would destroy EU with millions of victims, so that it would not seem that everything is just because of Russia. 28.5.2022."
1308,Are we just supposed to pretend that this guy isn't somehow related to Joe Pesci ?
1309,His hate of Russia is pouring out of my laptop's speakers. Totaly unaware of the Russian mind and heart. Disappointing .
1310,We LUV you too Lex! ;) Life is precious! ;)
1311,"why does he use ""WE"" so much?"
1312,If only he wasn't propaganda and one sided it could have been great
1313,"If what we see is not a global scale 1984 cosplay, Russia makes an antiglobalist move that will certainly have an impact that is disproportionate to its economic power. In that sense Russia is a superpower..."
1314,"Support you, Lex"
1315,"Half way through, I couldnt finish listening to the interview.  Kotkin is just too condescending a scholar.   I would still like to hear his rationale on why he thought Iraq war was a bad idea, given his allergic predisposition to dictatorship.  If invading Iraq is a bad idea, I certainly hope that he would not be arguing for a war with Russia."
1316,"Putin,XI, Modi, Macron all sound like leaders , in terms of basic courtesy and not being blabbermouth like US, UK leaders who sound bit dangerous."
1317,Love you too Lex. I was angry after the Stone interview. But then I had a little think and realised that you were not (necessarily) agreeing with Stone. We all look forward to hearing your views when you return dear Lex. Be safe.
1318,"Hey Lex, love the podcast; not sure where else to suggest this but there is a Psychologist named Steven Krashen who is an expert on Second Language Acquisition and his theory of the Affective Filter Hypothesis (which is closely associated with Chomsky‚Äôs ideas about language and how we come to understand it). He has a much larger body of work on the subject than that of course but I just wanted to give you a bit of background on the significance of suggest this guest. If you ever do read this thank your for your time, love the podcast!

Warmly,
-Your Friendly YouTube Comments Section"
1319,"Lex I love you, but enough bullsh please. Have Lavrov on or go to Moscow and interview Putin himself directly and show us a genuine conversation with the real arguments and counter arguments (and not these strawman arguments that your guest himself puts up and then tears down. Wtf is that, if not manipulation???).  This sh.. is so one sided, even I, a nobody, could counter half of what your guest said with facts and history and examples, off the top of my head. 

The fate of our entire species hangs in the balance. So facts matter. The truth matters. Don't you think that Russia, the largest nuclear superpower on Earth, deserves at the very least to state their claims and provide arguments and evidence in support of those claims? 
If not, then how do you ever expect to ""understand"" what is going on? Let alone find a solution. 

A lot is at risk. We are on a collison course with The East. CBDR! NUCLEAR this time.

And no I'm not Russian, not even close."
1320,"Stephen Kotkin is brilliant, great conversation.
Please get Victor Davis Hanson on the podcast."
1321,"This is an extremely politicized view , look at the examples Kotkin cites... they are emotional , subjective and omit key points ... This is the view of the US establishment. Stone has heart and soul ...who is telling the truth ? One seeks to inform freely , one seeks to influence, & manipulate."
1322,"War till the last Ukrainian! Good going, Kotkin"
1323,"40:56   A few minutes before that, the professor interpreted Russia's move based on their practice in the past. From this moment on, he explains that the ""West"" has also sinned in the past. Lex did not ask the key thing - how to trust the ""West"" when he showed the world that he was behaving like a tyrant, for example when they lied about weapons of mass destruction. And many times."
1324,The same Zelensky who thinks stephan bandera is a hero.
1325,Is he speaking about Russia or the CIA?
1326,"Bold move traveling to Ukraine and Russia following these interviews, please by safe Lex.  It is indeed a dangerous trip since you are a recognizable public figure, wishing you safe travels brother."
1327,"If you are free, your friends the turning backs (Jack Fowles). If you see the true nature of humans (tribal primates) it is hard to subscribe to any tribe fully. Perhaps, if you feel like that, you are after all not alone. There are a lots of them and with time their numbers only increasing, as of course the regression from those who are unwilling to grow to full adulthood, and still think the sun rotates around their tribal camping ground during the great process of migrations, conquests and coming and goings of kingdoms, tribal federations and empires.  
Nonetheless I hope you can visit both Russia and Ukraine in future and will be as welcome as the Americans are welcome in Vietnam today."
1328,support  Lex   stay  strong
1329,"great episode! also suitable to balance out the nonsense Oliver Stone spoke about on your podcast last week.actually, I never heard of Kotkin before, but I am glad I encountered him and his broad and rich depth of knowledge today. very valuable and informative conversation. I also loved his final answer on the meaning of life. thank you both!"
1330,"All throughout history folks have been trying to invade and take Russia.  Mongolia,  France, Germany  and Germany... this guy is very good at backtracking.   Good thing Stalin cannot see this nonsense .   Make a definitive stand Dyadya"
1331,15:50 - you'd have to be delusional to not see that is fact lol.
1332,"Fantastic interview, I‚Äôd also strongly recommend talking to professor frederick kagan, a military historian and expert on 18th and 20th century Russian history."
1333,"1:31:00 Had no idea how much this war was costing Ukraine and, by extension, U.S. taxpayers ($5 to $7 billion a month in economic costs alone).  Putin can and will use this to divide and conquer."
1334,Great...as allways..tnx
1335,"Excellent; what a contrast between Stephen Kotkin and Oliver Stone's interviews, thoughtful and accurate analysis (Kotkin) versus vague innuendo (Stone)"
1336,Dog food?  I thought zombies ate human flesh.
1337,Its good to hear the perspectives of a Neo-con on Russia and the Ukraine invasion and understand how they arrived to their analysis. Diversity of views is why I keep coming back to your podcast. Thanks Lex.
1338,I have to say Kotkin is MASSIVELY biased. it's very suspect how he speaks about things that are ahistorical and completely opinion in a way that makes it seem like fact. it's dangerous. Same thing he's warning about he's doing.
1339,"I thought that this interview would give reasons why this war is wrong, other than the simplistic ""Putin is crazy"". But at 47:44 Stephen says a couple of things that disappointed me very much:

""When a war doesn't go well it looks like lunacy"". Is this the ""Putin is crazy"" argument disguised as a pretentious sentence so you can get to the obvious conclusion yourself? Does he mean that the war is not going well so we can conclude that Putin is a lunatic? Note that the next sentence says that no wars go well...

""War never goes according to plan"". So he says that all wars go wrong, and therefore we must always assume that the aggressor is crazy? (According to his previous statement).

""All wars are based on miscalculations"". Why does he say that? I guess that there are no perfect wars, but no plans are perfect anyway (military and non military). I think that he wants the listener to think that this war is wrong, without giving better arguments.

""The problem is not the miscalculation, it's the failure to adjust (like a GPS)"". So we should have arrived to the conclusion that this war is wrong (all wars are supposedly wrong anyway), and therefore an adjustment must be made. What is that adjustment? I guess that Stephen wants us to get to the conclusion that the adjustment is basically stopping the attack.

Frankly disappointed. Stephen must be very proud of his empty and pretentious sentences. But I think that this is not the way to explain why this war is wrong."
1340,"Thanks for these interviews. 
Love & prosperity to you all. "
1341,"Thank you Lex.  Your integrity is what we need in this world, no matter what the century we are in.   Who you are brings hope to me that there  are human beings who are beautiful, loving and kind.   With tremendous heart and mind."
1342,"Sure , the former soviet satellites didn't need to be pressured , bribery was all it took .
I find this man to be very naive ."
1343,I loved this. Wish you both good health!

1348,Great pocast.
1349,The world needs more of Lex Friedman‚Äôs enlightened frequency.  
1350,Sooner have Stone in charge.
1351,"15:00  really wanted to listen that podcast, you lost me with Navalny is the second most important figure in russiaWhat the hell he is smoking?  
He isnt even in a top 10.000."
1352,"Thank you for introducing me to Stephen Kotkin. And thank you for an amazing, inspiring conversation."
1353,"Great inteview Lex, let the discussion continue soon, please!"
1354,"Love you too, Lex."
1355,Thank you Lex for sharing the Truth no matter how Outrageous it is ..Bless you !!!
1356,"Love ya, Lex"
1357,"I am glad to get different point of views on your podcast, but Kotkin is really hard to watch longer than 30 min. In my opinion he is a propagandist. Iam from Austria and its really hard for me to call Austria a Democacy when the Bundeskanzler who was never voted for in first place gets replaced within 1 Week by media and the next guy i dont even remember the name because he throw the towel within a few days (for sure it was not the paycheck he disliked)! But calling Ukraine a Democracy when Victoria Nuland decide that Jazenjuk is the guy to become primeminister is just a bad joke! At least in Austria they try to act like a Parlament and avoid fistfights there!
If you watch the decisions from all european leaders to suport the civilwar vs eastukraine, you need to be a dickhead to still belive these are independent decisions! He might be right with his analysis of comunism, but fails to see that we are going into global comunism."
1358,"Amazing. I love you both, thanks for the video."
1359,Neocons gonna neocon
1360,Wonderful podcast Lex good luck on your travels
1361,Safe travels Lex. May the governments and the people respect your sincerity. Thank you for whatever wisdom you can share.
1362,"Hmm....regarding the content @ 1:11:46, i find it difficult to accept that Ukraine's reality TV is about reality......Media will always be bias in any given context..."
1363,Fantastic! Best interview I've seen in several years.
1364,"Bit of an egocentric entry statement and I find this Russia (aggressor) Ukraine (defender) comparison wrt risk for travel not smart in general, but specifically because one is a dictatorship the other one a democracy"
1365,"Kotkin is a great calm speaker, and a great ideologue. But, he is so biais pro atlantist, that I could only take it to 1 hour 14 minutes."
1366,Lex. Your guests and and well thought out questions are by far the best. You are the new Charlie Rose.
1367,Brilliant the best pod cast conversation i have ever heard
1368,"well, i dont agree with most of your viewpoints and conclussions, you provide tv version of events"
1369,Yes! Love Kotkin and you Lex. What a fantastic episode.

1371,"I believe this was hard for Lex as he harbours dark admiration for Putin, however I do admire his bravery for confronting his fears, i.e. that Oliver Stone and Steven Seagal are wrong and Putin is an utter peice of shit. Keep up your amazing work Lex."
1372,"I have enjoyed Kotkin‚Äôs lectures for a few years now and really enjoyed round two. He‚Äôs a passionate scholar and an earnest soul, like you  Lex.  Best wishes and keep up the brave, clear eyed work."

1379,Realpolitik amateur....
1380,Once again Lex‚Ä¶ you are impressive‚Ä¶ such a wonderful humain being‚Ä¶!!!!!
1381,Thank you for providing both perspectives
1382,"Oliver Stone comes from the perspective of hate towards USA's empire policies and Kotkin comes from the perspective of hate towards Russia's empire policies. Oliver Stone cant fathom the senseless wars and death perpetrated by the US war machine blinding him to what pain and death Russia has also caused and Kotkin cant fathom the wars and loss of life perpetrated by Russia's war machine blinding him to the exact same on the US side. I agree that i prefer to live in a hawkish democratic country than a hawkish autocratic country, but one big fault does not excuse a lesser one, they are both at fault. Peace most come from us taking power to the individual and rendering the centralized power capability of making such decisions of war not possible.

Rubio conveniently ended the questioning without asking her to answer directly that those Labs do exist. Nevertheless, she had admitted by expressing concern over Russia gaining control.
