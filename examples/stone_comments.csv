2,"I never felt inclined to and never bothered leaving any comments at anything anywhere, however I've only just discovered Lex Fridman. Aside from his guests' personal views and opinions, I'm very impressed with his interviewing skills. The angle from which he drives the conversation, his manner and tone when asking his questions. It is always respectful and curious which in the end always translates to very insightful conversations. Great job."
3,"Oliver Stone, please protect the man for the future of this world!! So honest and eye opening interview in today's world of propaganda!"
4,"This is an outstanding interview such nice dialogue between both, very honest very smart thank you for both."
5,This is such a superb example of a quality conversation between two men who demonstrate mutual respect. Thank you to both of you for adding to the human experience of building insight and the generation of wisdom. This is like breathing in oxygen in an otherwise toxic eco system of  propaganda.
6,"Thank you Lex, great episode as always."
7,"""A healthy democracy will take criticism and shrug it off."" So true."
8,I am honestly disturbed buy this level of spin from someone I thought had insight. Great interview Lex
9,"This was very interesting to listen to, thank you!"
10,"Oliver Stone wrote on March 3 about Putin's ""mistakes"": 2) ""Overestimating the military's ability to achieve its objective."" - He doesn't say what the objective was and Lex doesn't ask him."
11,I really appreciate these long form conversations.  You really get to see alot of the person being interviewed.
12,Thanks for this. Great work by all involved. Few realise how close to the edge we all are.

14,"I don‚Äôt always agree with you lex, but I appreciate your work greatly. Ppl don‚Äôt really even realize that we‚Äôre in a new age of receiving information, n these conversations that you have with ppl from far left to far right  just means it‚Äôs a fair playing field. Thank you for accomplishing something Mainstream Media cannot"
15,You are truly a great person Lex
16,"""Censorship is a way of life when democracies also feel threatened. They're much more fragile than they pretend to be. A healthy democracy will take all the criticism in the world and shrug it off. And say okay that's what's good about our country."" 

That's a good point. Whether you agree with his opinions or not."
17,"This was brilliant. Thanks, Lex"
18,"Oliver Stone is absent of knowledge that nuclear meltdowns are deadly.  We had a roommate from Romania who was about School age when Chernobyl blew up. It was horrifying to hear about their experience. None of him or his sisters were ever able to have kids. Three Mile island produced cancers. It was known years ago that there was an increase in cancers afterward, and according to the documentary we watched on Netflix, I think it was, people surrounding the plants, and people who were in the in the direction the wind blew, got cancers. Fukushima is an utter human and environmental disaster.  Fish in our Pacific Ocean are contaminated with radiation from the Japanese releasing their coolant water into the ocean. We lived about 1,000 feet from shore in Oregon and we and others we knew in Astoria, got burning skin from the radiation. They knew how long it would take the wind to get it over the ocean to the US. Please don‚Äôt tell me nuclear plants are safe."
19,so keen to hear Oliver Stone is making a documentary about nuclear energy. Hoping to program it when it is released for our community-run environmental film series Be the Change.
20,"Thank you for posting and all the work that this entails!
Operating from the position of Love is key in these otherwise confusing and fearful times!!! Be the change, it's catchy!!!"
21,Wonderful conversation. Thank you. Much love Lex.
22,"Clever, honest, and brave... My deepest respect!"
23,I hope we get a round two.. I want to hear more about Oliver's take on JFK..
24,"Hey Lex, hope you see this, thank you for doing what you do! If possible you should try and have Peter Zeihan on."
25,Wow Lex I am very impressed with this interview.  so much so I've subscribed to your Podcast & Youtube Channel.
26,"Mr. Stone, I completely agree with your analysis of American foreign policy since WW2. No moral person can see America's actions as total selfish aggression. The world is not a board game. I grew up believing we were the good guys. At best, we are no better than anyone else...most likely worse than many."
27,I suggest Mr. Stone to confront his view of the situation in Donbas in 2014 with Mr. Girkin / Strielkov's interview given to Mr. Gordon. It can be inspiring.
28,"Take note, this is how you interview a guest.  You actually let them speak and let them finish their thoughts.  Excellent work Lex.  A+++"
29,"Great podcast Lex. This is how its suppose to work. Give them a platform allowing them to speak in relative comfort. Drawing them out for the world to see. Then allowing people to make up their own minds.

I think this worked very well with Stone. I find him to be as tribal as any. Performing mental gymnastics worthy of gold in his attempts to stay on side. There is a lot of truth in what Stone says but he never applies the same standards to his narrative.

Stone's analysis of Hitler's Germany taking it easy on Britain by not invading is so heavily flawed. Not only highlighting his problem with facts but also demonstrating how far into la la land he is willing to go."
30,"The number of casualties from nuclear that was mentioned is only the number that is public as people who were immediately affected by it. There are a few estimated numbers from various organizations that go into the hundred thousand and more as cancer rates, due to radiation and contamination. But obviously, it's difficult to pinpoint and connect these numbers. That said, I wouldn't dare to say that nuclear casualties are the lowest number of all the mentioned energy sources."
31,great stuff. The different view point is being expressed in a respectfully space without someone trying to argue or shame them simply because it sounds wrong.
32,"thank you Lex. you've got most quality humans in your interviews. many. i know, if Dennis Ritchie was alive, you would have interviewed him.
and thank you Mr. Stone, you are the voice of reason. now we need a modern version of the movie Born on the Fourth of July, where the victim has taken the jab for the team, got injured and the government is blind about his/her suffering after spending taxpayers millions on advertising for the ""vaccine"""
33,"I have a high regard for Oliver Stone, and I thought he had a lot of people skills. That he then votes for Biden, it falls in my estimation. Then his fear of Trump must be high. Biden has been in politics for so long, then you now know how such a loser that man is"
34,"""The line between good and evil runs through heart of every man. And who is willing to cut the piece of his own heart?"" 
To me the next sentence is even more powerful.. don't know why."
35,"First time I'm watching a Lex interview, and boy! You're so thorough, I'd watch you interview anyone for days and never tire. Amazing!"
36,Oliver is becoming more aligned and more like Steven Seagal as the years go by.
37,Wonderful interview man love this stuff so dam good not the crap we get from mainstream thanks lex
38,There is more value in a 10 minute clip from Lex interviews than the average person will gain from watching MSM for a year.
39,Oliver Stone speaks about Putin like a man who has been privately made aware of significant Kompromat.
40,1:34:40 ‚Äúthere is levels to this game‚Äù and Lex is definitely on the higher level then oliver. The way he opened him up without confronting him is just amazing
41,"Ollie had the lowest lowball question about energy and war (Middle East, DUH!) and choked on it"
42,This felt like a podcast after teleportation to 1956. Uncanny üòÇ Where's the time machine ü§î
43,I can listen to Mr. Stone for hours upon hours. Great stuff!
44,"Thank you, this was very helpful, well done."
45,"This video popped up because of Mr.. Stone  I'm learning more about as JFK movie ...thank you for the great interview and intelligent questions you put, the art of it."
46,"Fascinating insights, well worth a listen (even with an interviewer who has a veiled pretence of independent journalism)"
47,"Sincere thanks Lex for allowing such a wonderful interview, and my total gratitude to Oliver Stone who proved to be the knowledgeable honest human being I hoped he would be."
48,I would love it if nuclear energy got brought up as a legitimate solution and not just for fear mongering.
49,Honest person able to acknowledge faults who interviews the courageous and understands evil motives and power of micimate complex so subscribed.
50,"Stone is really good at shining a light on the reductive perspectives of the West, but he does it by applying a mirrored slant.  Sometimes I feel he got lost in the ""devil's advocate"" role and forgot that truth isn't a battle of binaries, it's a spectrum that gets presented as dichotomous to more easily sway people to one side or the other.  His countering arguments are important, but to me seem almost as shallow as what he's criticizing."
51,"Hey Mr. Stone! For the first time, in my life. It is ""Nuclear Energy"" that I agree with you!"
52,"Thank you Lex. Informative and stimulating interview, with a complex and genuinely honest Oliver Stone."
53,"Lex, I love the aesthetic, and I guess ‚Äúvibe‚Äù of your podcast. The mood and tone you‚Äôve cultivated is very your own, and I know when I watch a lex fridman podcast, I know what I‚Äôm getting, and on YouTube it‚Äôs rare for someone to carve out there own thing. Kind of a like having comfy blanket, while laying on a stiff couch.. if that makes sense. Anyway thanks lex!"
54,Very tasteful and classy interviewer. I first thought it was from the 1950-60s era. So good to see an interviewer who takes pride in the profession and looks like a ‚Äúreal journalist ‚Äú. So far good job asking relevant questions and just listen to the full answer and not interrupting like most interviews üéâ
55,"Thank You so much Lex & Oliver for this interview, I think we all  grew a little as humans paying attention to these carefully chosen questions and the honest delivery and expressions of truth during the discourse."
56,"Lex, you did an excellent job.  Great questions,  amazing perspectives were important to hear. Thank you for preparing & taking the extended time to interview Oliver Stone on delicate,  & yet seemingly unending issues both abroad & right here on our doorsteps. So important to capture his experience & knowledge of the world from historical & current events.  Love Oliver Stone."
57,"Thanks for an awesome conversation.
Even though it touched on some scary notions about the state of the world I enjoyed it immensely, and know that conversations like these is what is needed.
Keep them coming, and many thanks again."
58,Another amazing enlightening interview. Thanks!
59,"Lex, in my opinion this is your most timely work. Stone is uniquely placed to speak both on Putin and Ukraine. It's not a commonly known project, but Oliver has spent years working on documentaries related to Ukraine. On the other hand of course, his Putin interviews are incredibly famous. He may be a filmmaker, but this is also a man with a deeply informed and personal observation on the crisis unfolding before us. Great work."
60,"10:09 one died at Fukushima    ""in 2018, the Japanese government recognized the death of one Fukushima plant worker to be attributable to radiation exposure, disbursing compensation to his family. The worker, a man in his 50s who had spent nearly 29 years working at nuclear stations in Japan until September 2015, was in charge of measuring radiation at the Fukushima plant. In the period of December 2011 and September 2015, the amount of radiation he was exposed to more than doubled from roughly 34 millisieverts to around 74 millisieverts, as the Japanese newspaper Mainichi reported. The maximum level of radiation exposure workers should be exposed to is 100 millisieverts every five years‚Äîan annual exposure to that level of radiation is linked to an increase in cancer risk. The worker was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2016 and died of the disease.""  source  - forbes"
61,keep doing Lex.     done a great job here.        Kudos.
62,I wish they still made movies like PLATOON. It was so real to me when I watched it as a kid.  What a spectacular job and performances. Thank you Mr. Stone.
63,"Me siento avergonzado por no haber conocido antes tu canal. Te env√≠o mucho respeto y te agradezco por esta entrevista, tan necesaria y reveladora."
64,"Some excellent, smart questions with very good answers, thank you. But Mr. Stone should never have voted for Biden. A huge mistake that will stay as a stain."
65,"1:34:34
Congratulations on the dream coming true Lex; my throat clenched with joy and some vague pride when I heard him compliment you so forthrightly. Absolutely adore the both of you."
66,"I have a lot of respect Oliver Stone , a great artist one of the few people in Hollywood that you can watch him in an interview and not end up disappointed"
67,Thank you Lex and Oliver Stone. This is a marvellous conversation
68,"The question about ""power corrupts..."" was very clear and direct, but I was
 surprised to hear the response fly over and around it. That left me wondering what the interviewee wanted us to take away."
69,"Many things/perspectives that Stone comments on about things I don‚Äôt tknow much about or understand I find very compelling.

Then, whenever he casts his opinion about things or people I have actually studied or understand, I realise he follows a very blinkered, revisionist narrative about these things. Almost reflexively, he‚Äôll look for proof of his own leanings on things. And so I don‚Äôt trust his opinions on other things.

Regardless, a very talented and intelligent person. Just, perhaps, lacks self awareness of his own limitations."
70,"It was disappointing to not hear the word 'Thorium' when discussing the future of energy production by way of nuclear fission.  One would think that a documentary covering this subject would at least broach the subject.  Can ""walk-away-safe"" thorium molten salt reactors be made the technology of the future? Perhaps. Oak Ridge National Lab ran one successfully in the 1960s.
If as much effort is put into such a project as there was to develop light water breeder reactors that produce plutonium used in nuclear weapons, then it could be possible.  Since the future of humanity hangs in the balance, it's worth a try.

The other issue with light water reactors is the fuel.  Uranium is nowhere near as available in the earth's crust as thorium.
Uranium like many other metals is getting more difficult to find and exploit profitably.  Having 10000 reactors in the world rather than the present 200, imagine the fuel requirements AND storage of the radioactive waste for thousands of years.  Thorium does not have this issue.  The 'low' death toll for nuclear energy was cited.  But the consequential damage of radioactive elements pouring into the Pacific Ocean to this day at Fukushima was not addressed. Again, thorium energy would not have this issue.  

Mr. Stone says 'methane' like it's a dirty word.  Methane is the primary gas that comes from gas wells.  It is mixed with other gases like ethane, propane, butane and their derivatives.  These other gases are separated at source and used for the manufacture of petrochemicals.  Example... ethane is cracked to ethylene and polymerized to polyethylene.  A useful material in today's world.

When methane is burned, it produces carbon dioxide and water vapour.  Although methane is a more potent 'greenhouse gas' than carbon dioxide, it does not persist in the atmosphere.  Carbon dioxide is plant food and not as much of a contributor to global climate as is the sun.
Now, if thorium nuclear energy can displace the combustion of natural gas (aka methane, CH4) then this methane can be put to better use... Natural gas is a key source of fertilizers in the form of ammonia and urea.  What is not to like about this re-orienting of priorities?
I believe that nuclear fission energy is the future. We are in the right forest but barking up the wrong tree."
71,"18:25, a former member of the KGB, gave an interview on Koncrete, not that long ago. He spoke on what Oliver just stated, and he said thats exactly what Russia was trying to do."
72,"excellent interview, thank you"
73,"Excellent, simply excellent!
This discussion should be mandatory viewing to all journalist schools.
it sets a very high standard for a meaningful and earnest interview."
74,"Hey Lex .. 

First .. I listen to your podcasts *a lot* .. You are an engaging interviewer and I'm impressed with the caliber and diversity of your guests.  It must be an amazing experience for you as it is for us, your audience.   

I don't do Twitter (it's an abomination) so I ask my question here .. and if it gets lost in the ether .. so be it.

My question ..

I have not seen any interviews with past ""heads of state"".   I have noticed that your interviews tend to be with top scientists, film makers, etc ... essentially people at the ""top of their craft"".  But .. what about people at the top of power?   Have I missed some podcasts? .. Or do  these folks not deign to interview with you?  Do you try to court them in any fashion?   Would it be too difficult to honestly deal with people who are embroiled in the power game and need to maintain their message?  It would be nice to know a politicians true thoughts for a change.

Also, what about Bill Gates or Bezo's?   Have you tried enticing them on your show?    These are two people who have affected our landscape in an incredible way.   Even more so ,at the moment, (dare I say) than Musk.   I know I will get a lot of disagreement on that last statement.    My argument is basically this.  I am typing this comment using a Windows PC.  Later today I will shop on Amazon.  I don't own a Tesla though I am enthralled by them .. and the rockets.. just Wow.  But I digress.

I don't expect an answer to my queries.  My intent is to put a ""bug in your ear"" ..  ;-)

I think your podcasts are easily the best and they have personally broadened my horizons.  Please keep it up as long as you enjoy it."
75,"As time passes, Oliver Stone seems increasingly prone to holding beliefs that he wants to hold, rather than ones supported by evidence. He'll speculate wildly on some (or, many) things, while taking others at face value (Putin, for example), or continuing to hold onto conclusions formed during early impressions in lieu of adjusting based on new information."
76,"""The environmentalists have played a huge role in doing good things, many good things. But also confusing and confounding the landscape."" ~ Oliver Stone"
77,"Hello Mr. Stone, I appreciate your work. I would like you to re-examine the Chernobyl fatality rates."
78,"Oliver, you are really brave man! Free expression of your opinion is some kind of valiance today. Thank you for your throughout analysis which is out of imposed narrative and mass brain wash."
79,‚ÄúPoland was always attacking russia‚Äù whaaaat?üòÑüòÑ this guy is on putins pay roll for sure
80,"Amazing interview Lex! you ask such good questions and I really like how you let people say what they have to say. The hypothetical interview with Hitler was fascinating too, it gave me a better comprehension of why Oliver proceeds in the way that he does with his films. I like the fact that he gave both Bush and Putin a chance to speak, it shows an astounding level of openness in what he will talk about and with who. I did find him to be too pro Putin and anti Ukraine/ the west but it is a refreshing take on the situation at the same time too. The western propaganda machine has censored Russia too much, I would like to hear the propaganda from all sides, it helps me to realize that it is all propaganda"
81,"I really appeciated the way you conducted this interview.  Your questions were intelligent and asked in in a non-combative way that did not editorialise.  Importantly, you gave Mr Stone the space and time to answer the questions in his own fashion.  He was allowed to provide some context and explain his rationale.  As a result, i learned a great deal. Thank-you."
82,"I loved this interview both characters were fantastic. To interview a great interviewer must be difficult, well done!"
83,"excellent interview, thanks for this..."
84,All countries are sovereign in Oliver Stone's eyes.  But some countries are more sovereign than others.
85,"21:50 discussion of the Belgian Congo & Mobotu. I just read Naipaul's novel a bend in the river, a fictionalized, extremely deep exploration (and scary) about this situation"
86,"For the powerful, crimes are those that others commit. ‚ÄîNoam Chomsky

The object of power is power. ‚ÄîGeorge Orwell, 1984"
87,Wonderful chat. Stone is sounding a little like Michael Crichton when discussing nuclear power. Both bloody legends!
88,"Thank you 
I love your work , honest and very very interesting , intelligent and to a a level difficult to find ."
89,"A wonderful Interview. Thankyou, Gentlemen."
90,Thank you for this video. It gave me some eye opening information.
91,"As a computer science student myself I am learning that pressure, confusion, and mistakes are when I have my best moments of learning. By trying to create something and finding out why it is not working is almost a relief when  you find the error. I hated tech and computers in my teenage years, went back to college in my mid 20s , and the stuff I understand about programming and systems and data now, i would never of guessed I could learn it. I think what Mr. Stone is saying here is, while your young, learn as much as you can about everything, to make it a part of your life. To keep learning everyday is a blessing we have the ability to use."
92,"Thank you Mr.Stone for your thoughtfulness and Sincerity. I do believe you're right about fear. I think fear is a weapon to silence but there is a weapon to speak and His name is Truth, Faith over fear. I will have to look into more of your work. You too Mr.Fridman."
93,"Stone: ""Poland has always been attacking Russia as far as I remember back to another century I mean the two world wars that occupied Russia""..  interesting lol"
94,"""If you want a vision of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face -- forever.""  George Orwell"
95,I Love Oliver...free thinker. I had the same opinion about this conflict. good to know I am not alone
96,"""The real President is the one in control of the teleprompter."""
97,"The two biggest glaring things that popped out at me regarding Stone's views in this interview is 1) his casual portrayal of Putin as having ""defended"" Russia against Chechnya and Georgia. The invasion of Chechnya for example was justified based on a false flag attack and it was needlessly annexed by Russia, and ironically the Russo-Georgian war has a LOT of parallels with the current Russo-Ukrainian war. 2) his claim that Hitler showed some sort of a kindness to England by not invading them; in reality, ALL of his generals knew and told him in no uncertain terms that an invasion of England was absolutely not logistically possible. The D-Day invasion itself was almost impossible, and it depended on YEARS of massive American industrial output, whereas Germany couldn't have even handled the construction of just the landing craft that the Allies used."
98,"Stone's expression after commenting on Bucha - Lex obviously gave a ""don't go there"" look..."
99,"People were amazed when the Soviet Union collapsed of how peacefully it all went.

But it only took a while to get bloody."
100,"What a world we have if one group is constantly taking advantage, or setting policies and demanding adherence of others.  Like a bunch of bullies in the playground relishing the fun of intimidating and herding others.  With time ambiguity, or acquiescence leads to complicity.  Thought we had bigger issues/problems to solve."

102,"Lex, your podcast is so incredibly well done. Thank you from the bottom of my heart."
103,"Oliver Stone one of the great film makers of his time, he gets to the heart of the matter what ever he creates."
104,"Thank you, Lex. Great interview."
105,That's how podcasts should be. Thank you very much.
106,"Excellent interview, Thank you."
107,"Made it to 1:39.  No Lex, there is evil in the world; there are evil people in the world.  We are not all the same."
108,"My favorite interview of yours , besides Elons of course, is Josha Bach . I watched it 3 times! What a fascinating man  :)"
109,Thank you very much Lex for interview. Good luck!
110,what a beautiful interview. thanks a ton to both of you.
111,"Dommage , ce serait bien , s'il y avait la traducton en francais de son interview en dessous, d'autant que j'aime bien Oliver Stone"
112,"You‚Äôve talked about interviewing Putin on some of your recent podcasts, would be very interesting for that to come to fruition! Would be a very interesting podcast to listen to and to hear his perspective. Keep up the good work Lex!"
113,4:53 Myths about nuclear energy have made nuclear energy politically infeasible. Looking forward to the documentary.
114,Fantastic interview ! Thanks to both of you ü§ó
115,"Lex is good. Great interview.

However, why didn't you ask Oliver what Russia's military objective was? 

Oliver said the poisonings outside of Russia was never proven to be from Putin. Why didn't you ask who ordered it then? And why?"
116,"As always lex at his best. 
A much needed interview for recent times."
117,"You sir, are a gem. Thanks for your perspectives. I am you are we."
118,"I was knew the guy who was translator in Oliver‚Äôs interviews with Putin, awesome man"
119,Fantastic interview!!!!!!
120,By far the biggest problem is Methane escaping from Permafrost but it is less of a problem if used rather than become a greenhouse gas
121,"Love Oliver Stone, his movies and interviews, but in this case he is speaking out of both sides of his mouth. Putin's attempt to absorb parts or all of Ukraine is completely wrong. I do agree however about U.S policy to confront all rising power threats, economic or military. Overall, a very, very interesting interview and view points."
122,"Great interview, Lex!  It's the first time I've watched an interview from you. Your an amazing interviewer and please keep it up! Thank you for doing your shows!"
123,Absolutely amazing interview. Thank you. It's really hard to get unfiltered information today.
124,"This was a great interview & helped me realize having a conversation regarding Russia‚Äôs side of this war with anyone in Oliver Stone‚Äôs generation will be a challenge as they have been raised with the idea that U.S is the good guy and Russia is evil. I‚Äôm Not saying they haven‚Äôt done some evil things but our hands are nowhere near clean. So If you  care about the people of Ukraine and you support the war, then you are a proxy-moron. Oliver said so much of my thoughts from watching an interview of Putin in 2019. Again not saying he‚Äôs great, I‚Äôm saying he seems more level-headed than the monster the U.S wants us to believe he is. That‚Äôs all. But on another note is Lex single ? lol - asking for a friend üòú"
125,"I have visited Ukraine in 2014, there were no nazi deathsquads commiting asassinations"

128,"""Seek to understand."" That was the line that resonated the most for me. This was my first video on your channel so I didn't quite understand your introduction. It made sense, of course, by the end. Well done. Thank you for this interview,"
129,What a beautiful reflection at the end on death and the preciousness of life.
130,Keep it up Lex!  Doing great work!
131,Excellent interview
132,"Ok, totally non-related, but I would love to listen to an ASMR by Lex.  Especially one in which he says it's all gonna be Ok."
133,Fascinating interview ...üëèüëå
134,"Thank you, Lex, for such a meaningful and thoughtful interview with Oliver Stone, who is without a doubt one of the greatest filmmakers and interviewers. He documented some of the most important people and made movies of the most important if not tragic events is our history.  Great, great interview."
135,Thank God Lex cares enough to get this message out
136,"Thanks for the time stamps.  It's really helpful.  Best wishes from Patagonia, Chile."
137,Oliver Stone mentioned Central America. I'm happy to hear he is very well educated on conflicts around the world through out the 20th century. The country of El Salvador is going through a major change. And it's not making the U.S happy. Oliver Stone could make a new documentary for El Salvador adoption of Bitcoin and the new president Nayib Bukele. Even Lex should invite Bukele for a conversation.
138,"38:00 Some would argue that Yeltsin put Putin in charge because of state secrets and that Putin showed disrespect to Yeltsin from the very first day he handed power over to him when Yeltsin was calling him to congratulate him and all Putin could say was he would call him back (which he never did.) 

Bill Clinton warned Yeltsin that Putin would be a danger to democracy (and it was during a visit by Putin to the White House where Clinton was eying him over and wondering where he stood on positions,) which initially Yeltsin brushed off but in the last years of his life came to express agreement with."
139,Nice job lex. It's still smoke and mirrors or we'd be getting stock tips without the red tape
140,Thank you for the great interview.
141,"Great collection of conversations, great for the commute."
142,Interesting perspective from Mr Stone. He‚Äôs essentially blamed every Russian show of aggression across their history post WW2 on US cloak and dagger moves behind the scenes.
143,"Two of the most relaxing speaking voices, not to mention great interviewers."
144,Thank you so much for this interview. It is more then awesome.
145,you are a faboulous interviewer lex
146,"Great interview.  Most enjoyable.  Many thanks Lex, I learned many things during this time well spent."

149,"What a thoughtful, considerate and measured interviewer you are Lex. Was a privilege to journey with you for the last 1hr, 52 minutes and 38 seconds. Thank you."
150,Outstanding interview! Thanks

156,I remember watching the Putin 2007 speech and the sneer on John McCain's face. McCain was  absolutely disgusting.
157,Wall Street (1987) still one of my favorites
158,"When the people reason through their opposing ideas in this modern social media way, as ugly as it can be, the people have the opportunity to hone their ability to see what is reasonable. Optimistic. They get stronger."
159,"lol at Mr Stone feeling we ""Europeans don't have a sense of sovereignity"". Welcome to reality Oliver. üòÖ"
160,"Great interview! Thank you, Lex."
161,Great interview
162,Major respect to Lex ! He managed to maintain his usual composure despite the personal aspect to all of the topics particularly towards the end in relation to interviewer objectivity and hitler. Keep it up
163,so let me get this straight. he‚Äôs been extremely bothered by this country‚Äôs attitude towards putin and russia for most of his life‚Ä¶ then he votes for biden? that‚Äôs where you lost me. just doesn‚Äôt add up.
164,Love to hear he‚Äôs views on Davi‚Äôs & the WEF
165,Fantastic interview
166,very interesting interview from all sides. thank you!
167,"‚ÄûNuclear hasn‚Äòt killed many people‚Äú well‚Ä¶ it is kinda true, it killed much less than what some eco-fanatics make you believe but that only like 15 people died at Chernobyl is just wrong. Very few people died of radiation poisoning. A lot of people died of cancer. Difficult to measure how many cancer deaths would not have happened without the buclear accidents but as far as I remember the lowest estimates were in the ten thousands."
168,Thank you for bringing up France and Germany. I point out this case study every time the green energy conversation crops up.
169,You guys go deep. Thank you both. I appreciate a great conversation.
170,"Mr. Stone is definitely an admirable intellectual. I'm always up to hear his take. Always interesting, erudite and entertaining too.
As one who clearly admires and acknowledges the worth and tragedy of JFK, to be consistent, Mr. Stone must do the same for Trump. To not do so, isn't about Trump or JFK or me. It's a matter of consistency,  credibility and integrity."
171,He would easily find a job on russian TV. I mean Stone.
172,Waiting to see how this - and Lex's podcasts which stand in direct contrast to the views expressed here - will age...
173,Great interview Lex
174,Let's not forget Oliver Stone was also one of the writers for the 1st Conan movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger
175,"I agree with Stone's advocacy for nuclear power, but (at around16 minutes) coal and oil are worse than methane or natural gas when looking at energy per mass or amount of additional pollutes."
176,Great interview as always. Would love to see you interview Peter Zeihan to discuss the geopolitical and demographic forces that are undermining the world order and may result in famine for 2B people
177,Lex was emotional in this interview...I think he wasn't fair as always
178,"Oliver ""I really must say I understand dictators, they're actually great people"" Stone. rofl"
179,"One positive in an ocean of negative, Oliver Stone"
180,I always laugh at the compliments towards Putin lol.....  He sure is a swell fella right?.....
181,Oliver stone paints a strange picture of the world where Stalin and Guevara were victims and not violent and imperialists in their own right‚Ä¶
182,"Power might or might not corrupt an individual, but power does attract the corruptible, or the already corrupted. The military industrial complex has fallen under the control of corrupt or criminally minded people, who would then use the complex to further their own individual goals. Humans are in control of this planet, not some abstract bureaucracy. It's just easier to blame bureaucracy, instead of ourselves. As you say Lex, evil lies in every heart."
183,"Probably not the best comparison of Putin being kgb to hw Bush being cia in an effort to downplay it, especially in the same conversation of the jfk assassination and the consequences that had considering HW was at the very least complicit in the jfk assassination."
184,"Oliver Stone is duplicitous.
It was NOT anti-Russian in the 50s.
It was anti-Communist.
Words matter Oliver.
I‚Äôm Not a Leftist, much less a Socialist or Communist.
I am a Conservative Traditionalist.
I am an anti-Leftist, at minimum.
But I am rooting for Russia to re-establish itself as a thriving nation.
It is a tragedy that the Russians felt they were put in an existential position.
You don‚Äôt speak for anyone but yourself Oliver. And your father was right. There was active efforts to infiltrate and sow discord in the US by the Soviets. We are seeing the results now.
How do you like it ?"
185,Well done üëç
186,"Loved your intro, you are a light in the darkness Lex. Keep up the great work"

Then and now ... who knew? Kubrick did ..."
189,"I disagree with Mr. Stone's view on methane. Methane is the first compound in the methane series and benefits greatly by the formula for the methane series. That formula is CnH2n +2.  This gives methane a unique boost from the +2 part of the equation. Two water molecules are produced by every reaction between the oxygen supplied by the air with each methane molecule. This +2 bonus quickly disappears as the methane series climbs to the heavier molecules in that series approaching, in the limit,  one water molecule. The heat produced is directly related to the heat of fusion of this water. Methane leaking from abandoned oil wells is a definite problem as Mr. Stone is correct in its global warming effect. If it is burned, the only reaction products are water and carbon dioxide."
190,Award-winning question at 33:41... It's something I wonder about. Can any human being handle an extreme amount of power for long periods?
191,"Oliver, Platoon was by far your best works. Some will not understand it was not a war movie but a documentary of what actually took place. I was there in 68/69 on the Cambodian border in war zone D,  11th ACR and 25th, the people your movie was about. I was assigned to spec ops and the ARVN 10th Division out of XuanLoc and TayNinh training ARVNs and Kit Karson scouts. I love your menatilty in this modern world, we think a lot alike. And a lot of that is because of our life experiences are very much in common. I realize you were up north and not in the 25th. ."
192,lex has never said something interesting or funny in his entire life
193,I'm here in the U.S. and able to watch this interview on YouTube.  I wonder what would happen if Oliver Stone was interviewed in Moscow and said that the WAR in Ukraine is a mistake?
194,"22:50

""Poland has always been attacking Russia... the two world wars that occupied Russia so tragically - entry points were always through Poland and Ukraine.""

Wow. 

I think Lex exhales from the comedy right after that statement. Glad I wasn't the only one."
195,"Thank God for Oliver Stone, and in some sense I‚Äôm inclined to say the same about a certain Russian leader‚Ä¶"
196,"The correlation between energy and war... That's a great question, Lex."
197,"Andrei Illarionov would be a great guest, he was an ex advisor of putin"
198,"Thanks for a great interview. In UK, we are starved of anything but a narrow line of propaganda regarding Putin and the war."
199,fantastic talk between both. Great questions Lex üëè
200,"Great interview Lex. Well said Mr Stone, there are many in the west who think as you do‚Ä¶."
201,"He's a great man. Planet of the humans? I've been following him ever since I discovered him then.  Volunteered for Vietnam, cos his dad raised him that way, then mocked him when he returned alive, telling him it wasn't a real war, he'd only been a policeman, so he makes a movie to explain to his dad, and has been making movies ever since, and the best bit I've heard him say about portraying something is to get both sides of the story. I texted a love email to someone i may never see again, and I know it goes viral, but I got serious brain injury wrong diagnosed and lost 7 years and fell head over heals in love with the health admin woman, and the whole world of women and love is opening to me as i battle utter hell to get help i was denied 7 years ago... and looking at an important topic like a 61 year old suddenly wanting love, and now I've got an amazing love story complete with drama you can't imagine, and Oliver certainly is inspiration to tell the story... he's an amazing gift to humanity."
202,"When he talks about Syria around 1:27:00, he's referring to the OPCW. Check out Aaron Mate's reporting on that."
203,I didn‚Äôt know this man had so many idears.
204,13:30 lex asked a fantastic question!
205,"I think guys like him and Noam Chomsky have some valid points about US imperialism, but then they get lost in the sauce and go way overboard. At a certain point it turns into anti-Americanism instead of anti-imperialism. He rants about Americans not respecting sovereignty but then says Russia doesn‚Äôt have to respect Ukraine‚Äôs sovereignty. Regardless, I enjoyed this conversation."
206,Oliver wakes up everyday and cries about the fact he‚Äôs not born in Russia üòÇ
207,I would have never saw this coming.   Great guest.
208,Great interview!! It's hard to hear any other opinion on the current Russia/Ukraine situation without screeching of MSM flying monkeys. BTW any comments on US occupation of Somalia? Or that is all good...I didn't see any Somalia flags on ppl avatars or anything like that...or call for help...or anything. Strange..not.
209,Thank you for this thoughtful conversation
210,Oliver stone one of the best.  üôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôèüôè
211,"A ton of peeps from my family, and my village in the North of Norway have various forms of lymphatic problems and cancers. Oh, and they all saw glowing clouds emanating from the Novaya Semlya nuclear testing of Soviet Russia. That's where they blew up the Tsar Bomba."
212,"I hope the Uighurs in China will get the same attention one of these days. Its silly that this video makes me think of that but it just popped in my head and I wanted to share, because everyone deserves a fair world. I mean concentration camps... what is there more to say that should unite people."
213,"incredible interview, I had to come back a few times. thanks."
214,Love how he speaks about Greek philosophy! A great documentary about Greek philosophy by Stone would be worth watching! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
215,"I have listened to 1 hr. 33 min. so far and I wonder why Mr. Stone ‚Äúfeared‚Äù Trump. Trump was in favor of a relationship with Putin and also did not pursue foreign wars ( tried to bring our troops home). He was in favor of national sovereignty, ours and other nations. I will continue to listen and see if Mr. Stone elaborates on this further."
216,I just started watching. What an opening Lex! Brilliant.
217,"Listening to Oliver Stone in this vid reminds me of the interview of Aaron Russo and Alex Jones, Aaron Russo also made a documentary movie, he was friends with Nick Rockefeller who tried to groom/initiate Aaron into the ‚Äònew world order‚Äô cabal, but Aaron couldn‚Äôt be part of it, before 9/11 Nick told Aaron that there was going to be an ‚Äòevent‚Äô and after this event American soldiers would be looking in caves, and that Nick said their ‚Äòendgame‚Äô that they are working towards is to have everyone on the planet microchipped and under complete control. The CBDC‚Äôs (central bank digital currencies) being worked on are a major step in this direction"
218,Oliver Stone is awesome!
219,"I believe the restriction of business, embargo and isolation against Russia from the world is leading to the worst scenario .. this a country that have nuclear weapons.. the USA is leading Nato Nations down the wrong path.. the weaker nations will suffer . If Russian allies get involved  there will be no happy ending for anyone especially Europe"
220,Just great.  Thanks Lex and Oliver.
221,Great interview
222,"Great point Lex, I too worry about the capacity of scientists to be used as pawns in part due to arrogance. Thomas Sowell describes this problem as a trust that expertise in one area extends to all areas."
223,Excellent work by Mr Fridman. Great diction and smart questions for the ever shining star Oliver Stone.
224,Thank you for interview that what  people need to hear and see to understand reality and come up from there babble and see the reality üôè
225,"These men, both in their own right, are doing mankind a great service. I very much enjoyed this. Thank you."
226,"One question I have about nuclear power is, what if an adversary bombs a nuclear power plant, like levels it?  

I can‚Äôt find the answer to that anywhere.  I fear this world now because questions like this are not known by people like stone and yet he is full throttle on it.  I‚Äôm totally not against it, but if it‚Äôs the case that a bombing from above would result in a meltdown then that possibility is too great.  I mean if it‚Äôs the case that this occurrence would cause 50 square miles to be permanently uninhabitable, then sorry, that is just too great.  If it‚Äôs possible it will happen in war, at some"
227,P.S. Trust me Bush knew EXACTLY what he was doing! Exactly.
228,"Now that you have interviewed Oliver Stone, and with the views he has, it would be good and fair to interview Gary Kasparov, as he has the opposite view and he is Russian."
229,"As a post-modernist Oliver Stone is not able to call Hitler and Putin evil, yet he likes talking about ""love""."
230,Smart man Stone. His interview with Putin several years ago was awesome.
231,"""My goal isn't to agree with you. My goal is to understand you."" - Me"
232,"Good interview but over time I‚Äôve lost the admiration I ince had for Stone. It all started when I saw some LA salesperson convince him (on You Tube) to replace his Parasound Audio gear with Onkyo. Something I knew something about. Check it out and comments.He allowed himself to be conned. Many people I‚Äôve found to be gullible that I once respected. The information is often not wrong just grossly incomplete and biased. You could tell by a person‚Äôs one sided use of adjectives. Stone‚Äôs mind is made up.  That said, I wish someone Stone respected would challenge him. There are many Russians who may be able to corner him at some party perhaps. But it would be like telling someone their wife is cheating on them. It would only make him hate that person but it should be done."
233,How can you say that Mr. Putin was on the cover of Times Magazine person of the year 2007?
234,what an excellent interview!!
235,Lex Thanks so much for this interview. I was tremendously relieved to see someone uplift Mr. Stone for his amazing interviews and I have watched them all several times because Im so impressed by how putin is persecuted and still holds his ground. hes steady and focused
236,"Thank you Lex, Thank you Oliver! Love the interview just quick point on the comments! The confederacy of comments is truly rare , rare to see everyone sharing the same humble kind of  views.  your on the right path Lex. Cannot wait for your Putin interview!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oliver Thank you for JFK, PLATOON, Born on 4th,  your moral honesty is inspiring you have always settled for position history acquits you in. your always criticized to be proven right. Love the movies doors, NBK, NIXON was well made for seeing into nixon. Thank you keep up the movies, documentaries aswell"
237,"Have never watched Lex Fridman interviews before. Due to this one being Oliver Stone who I have great respect for, I thought I'd take a look. My goodness what a great interview, so well presented by Lex with great topics and questions. Certainly will be looking through his catalogue of interviews and watching many I'm sure.Excellent!"
238,"Excited to watch this, love intelligent discussions"
239,Churchill tried to make a deal with Hitler in 1938? That's new...
240,"Oliver Oliver how can you speak so well of Putin , I am in shock .
I can‚Äôt finish listening."
241,"31:43 oh so it‚Äôs America‚Äôs fault that Russia is the aggressor. Dang those Americans, managed to turn Russians into villains all by themselves"
242,I loved this interview. thank you!
243,"Our generals have been sad to see Putin do all this obvious horror to himself, to his own country, to Ukraine most of all.   TOO sorry for him.  Azov was right wing in the beginning....and Ukraine is NOT a terror state."
244,"One of the best interviews  you had. Or better ,one of the most important interviews lately about the background of this war"
245,Outstanding interview
246,"Good interview. Nice to listen to. So long, Marianne ;)"
247,This is a Master Class on how to do a proper interview. Most excellent!
248,Thanks both. Most insightful podcast yet for me and long may you broadcast.
249,"Congrats for the great interview, I wish Oliver Stone become the president of the US and similar people are in congress."
250,Great interview. I tuned in because I love Oliver Stone. Then I Subscribed to Lex Fridman because I was so impressed with his interview skills.
251,Love Stones films but how can anyone take anything he says seriously when he voted for Biden...
252,"Three Mile Island didn't have direct death when the ""incident"" happened but was there long term health issues people suffered from it that shortened their lives?"
253,"OliverStone puts his own spin on the facts. He also shows to be a poor judge of leadership if he thought for a minute that Dementia Joe, fully in thrall to the Security Regime that brought us the rise of ISIS, and resulting Sex Slavery, horrifying scenes of mass murder and horrific executions of POWs and the overthrow of Gaddhafi and the resulting slave markets would be a better strategist and stronger leader than Trump.
What a fool.
Stone has made some engaging movies, but I do not find him compelling as a political analyst or historian."
254,i hope more people get into these podcasts. feel too many people cling to headlines and captions that offer very little substance and a great deal of emotional knee-jerks
255,Since Sarkozy France has shifted from neutral to not neutral. Sarkozy has cleaned all the hierarchy in the military and the intelligence services that were still in line with the neutrality from the De Gaule era. Every president since Sarkozy has something in common with Sarkozy.
256,"It‚Äôs refreshing to see an interviewer allowing Oliver Stone to talk without interrupting, I just discovered this guy I subscribed it."
257,Used to hate Oliver but he is a soldier for freedom and that means more than most disagreements.
258,"15:20 Interesting he does not speak on intuition that we all do, when asked about war and energy."
259,Most of us have lost the ability to think critically. We hide this by calling those who present a different view insane.
260,"Stone is 100% correct on the US, though."
261,"""Democracy forgives a lot of sin"" - O.S."
262,I love how he talks about his opinions and selective arguments as fact. I kind of feel our plasticity of opinions and our open eye objective evaluations gets reduced as we age.
263,Best interview Lex has done so far and I've watched all of them! I wish I could give 100 likes to this video!
264,1:31:54 Stone says I voted for Biden because I was afraid of TRUMP. He voted for an obviously demented man who can barely get through a paragraph without gaffing. I AM AMAZED THIS VOTED FOR BIDEN. I know that's my problem but REALLY?

266,"I don't remember how this interview appear on my screen a few days ago. It is so lengthy I had to interrupt it and finished the rest now. This is awesome. Questions were so good so penetrating. Oliver Stone was so generous opening his brains to show us there is so much more in life than what we are led to perceive. Wonderful.
On the question of life it began when we discover our brains. It is so exhilarating when we put something in it. It is so satisfactory when we can come up with something nice. If were to try hard our Monkey king could always push the Buddha hand (paradigm) back. 
You two are still a long way from your Buddha's hand. Enjoy the ride. 
I certainly was exhilarating watching the interview. Tks."
267,What an interview.
268,"The hard work you‚Äôve been doing is readily apparent, and appreciated."
269,"His Untold History of the United States series is a must watch. Great interview Lex, I see you really trying to be more empathetic and expansive in your work. I‚Äôd like to think Rick Rubin tilted your perspective, too (he is iconic)"
270,"Lex, you allowed him to help us all broaden perspective even with the constraints of cancel culture clearly troubling Oliver. Thank you, this is an amazing interview considering the propaganda wars."
271,"This  was  the  greatest  interview  I have seen, I much appreciate  the open heartiness and truth  of both the interviewer and  Mr stone  thank you so much üôè"
272,"On the discussion of nuclear, the I believe race to the fusion reactor is the most important discussion. and the UK seems to be leading the race"

I now live in Alanya Turkey region and a beautiful Med Sea climate.
324 days of üåû annually. 
Yesterdays temp (29th May) was 35c and almost ten hotter than last year 
(climate change it's been said.)

Mankind, at stages in world history; has always been expendable."
276,Regarding Energy being a reason for starting war - I have understood that the primary reason Japan attacked Pearl Harbor was because of the US was limiting the oil supply to Japan and Japan felt their only option was to destroy the US Atlantic Fleet so they could be able to take control over the South Pacific.
277,I'm with you all the way Oliver <3
278,"Thank you for making this happen Lex!
This was sad to watch, however. Stone's defence of RT's journalistic standards is just embarrassing. I don't get why people think that picking RT in opposition to BBC, AP, Reuters, or PBS will suddenly make you a truth-seeking independent thinker. Stone's views and his docs on Ukraine are full of misconceptions about Eastern European history, not to mention the praise for Putin or more recently Medvedchuk. The unapologetic pro-Kremlin messaging is indistinguishable from RT pseudo investigations and conspiracy documentaries."
279,what an opening..love it x
280,Stone seems to underestimate russia but at least he is more neutral and not like msm.
281,Lmao if this interview happend a week later there would be talks of George Busha saying Iraq
282,"Lex, I really enjoy your podcasts, pretty much without exception, but often you have a guest on where the conversation flows in such a way that it's a case of ""sit back, relax and enjoy"". Sure people have subjective opinions - but it's so engrossing to learn how a person, a mind, comes to their conclusions and explains the progressive observations. Maybe I'm sounding a little high falutin, but it's really like successful dinner party... now I have gone too far! Cheers from London ol' chap!"
283,Love Oliver Stone. Thinking about Lex‚Äôs tart spooky whole ü§î
284,"1:24:40 I would like to discuss the Budapest Memorandum of December 5, 1994, which the distinguished Mr. O Stone does not bring up by pressing the nuclear weapons pedal, as if Ukraine (still) had such an arsenal, Mr. Stone, passing in silence over this treaty; the fact that Russia is the one that does not recognize and does not respect this treaty, like many other treaties (still) in force. In fact, Russia is positioning itself on a strategy of reconsidering all political and territorial establishments in Europe with a single purpose: as long as it promotes and supports a policy of denial of political bases and territorial treaties between European countries, it creates the context to put in question the stability of any region by free will. In other words: ""The Russian state does not recognize this status quo, so it claims its right to act accordingly."" Europe itself, each region has been the subject of countless wars throughout history, countless empires have forcibly encompassed entire nations (Balkans, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Yugoslavia, Romania, Bulgaria, Ottoman Empire, Greece, Cyprus, Crimea, Baltic countries, Poland, Prussia ...). So I'm quite disappointed in Mr. Lex Friedman that he's not asking Mr. O Stone the questions. From my point of view, the dialectic that Mr. Stone ""adopts"" (in fact, I allow myself the freedom to say ""borrow"") is that of reversal of roles: the aggressor is in fact the victim. The aggressor, in fact, is not so detestable, because he may have had some motive to carry out his actions, because, isn't it, Mr. Stone, the victim could have been guilty as well. I understand that Mr. Friedman is in a deep admiration for his guest (and I would be so), but I think the right questions better put certain situations in context."
285,"It's easy to ""express yourself freely"" when you are a dictator or a billionaire.Jeez...."
286,Glory to Ukraine inside Russian Federation. Make Russia Stronger Again. Long live Putin and smart people around him.
287,Stone is clearly in love with Putin
288,"""Even Switzerland has joined the cause"". It joined the cause in WWII too,  by keeping Nazi gold safe. I think Stone should make a movie about Sean Gervasi although Gervasi`s son is a famous director too."
289,"There are several points during this interview that Stone literally sounds insane. After watching a few of Lex's discussions, I get the impression that he is not going to push back a lot with his guests, but I really wish he had done so a few times here."
290,"Fridmen your Persantation is very impressive and your ability of digging important issues is very impressive,,"
291,Wow Oliver is starting to get out of touch with reality.
292,One of Lex‚Äôs best interviews; I love how Oliver Stone speaks with no filter and no ego. And his knowledge of history is unprecedented.
293,You should interview Scott Ritter. Also Ray McGovern. And Regis Tremblay.
294,Thanks Lex -the best dressed podcaster on the web. Great guest.
295,Have you ever interviewed Bush? Would be interesting to listen to what he has to say about the USA empire when he was the ruler.
296,"France never actually left NATO, per se. DeGaulle downgraded France's membership in NATO and withdrew France from the U.S.-led military command to pursue an independent defense system.  In 2009 France rejoined NATO's military command."
297,"Mr. Stone I really prey for your well being, just because the globalists simply do not like people like you!"
298,"If a 200 meter (in  height) industrial wind turbine was installed  on every square mile of all USA land and if one third of all
the USA's  land mass was  covered with solar farms,  (assuming there was no nuclear).   Next if for some reason all fossil
fuel was unavailable,  these renewables cannot be used at all.    No non nuclear electrical system can operate on wind and
solar alone.   Oliver should have interviewed me."
299,"Waiting for the podcast ""Biden, Zelenski and war in Ukraine"""
300,"I love this man, his sense for justice, his look and beautiful, soft voice... although discusses politics his voice is very sexy:)))
God bless, please take care"
301,"WOW What an interview,  My thoughts and thinking exactly. Thank you,


Can you try and interview S. Lavrov"
302,Really great interview!
303,Really sad when Roger gets duped by one shell in the shell game.
304,"I am from Denmark. My government have gone completely mad since the war. Now any sense there were left has been lost in the name of ""green energy"", and ""cut of Putin's income"". The problem is however, that they always chose the wrong paths, leading us into complete future failure, because they are shutting down our energy sources and stability, before we have any real alternatives for the future, effectively cutting of the country's limbs.
Politicians think everything can be solved with solar panels on the roof, and magic."
305,"I've just discovered Lex, i'm amazed by the guests he gets and am yet to research his background, but even more impressive is his listening skills. I find him such an accomplished interviewer precisely because he doesn't say all that much, he elicits some really great stuff from his guests that way, and clearly it resonates - the next big podcast it seems!"
306,This feels like an Op Lex. Musk as well? We see you Lex.
307,"I agree that nuclear energy is the only real alternative in the short and medium term. But it is not true that only 50 people died in the Chernobyl accident. Yes, maybe, in the accident, but many more people died, thousands, due to the consequences of the accident."
308,"Thank you for doing this interview. Oliver Stone was the one who introduced me to Jimmy Dore's show, for that alone I am eternally grateful. To say nothing of the body of work he's done and the courage with which he's gone against the strongest of grains throughout his career whether it was Fourth of July, the Putin Interviews, the Snowden movie, the 'True History...' his military service, his outspoken speeches when receiving awards and on and on..."
309,"‚ÄúAnd here comes wackadoo film  director Oliver Stone, Oliver is here promoting his new movie ‚ÄúBorn on the Fourth of July 2: Born on the Fifth of July‚Äù which he promises will be even more ‚ÄúJuly-ier‚Äù than the original. A dangerously insane human being.‚Äù"
310,"One dimension regarding Hitler: he was aware that Britain rapidly realised the wrong that was Versailles, and worked to walk it back and not drive it forward."
311,This is one of the top interviews I have heard in many years. Thanks Honesty is obvious Excellent job
312,"Great interview, great questions, answers and insights."
313,"I agree with this man !
Try to watch ""Pandora Promise"", a great documentary"
314,Thank  you so much for such intresting interview!!!!
315,Love Lex's accent - sounds like Travis Bickle
316,"I would like to recommend an important book called ""The Grand Chessboard"" (1997) by Zbigniew Brzezi≈Ñski. He explaines the american geoplitics regarding china, europe and russia."
317,"Good interview by Lex, but a lot of the things Stone is saying is insane."
318,Great show
319,I am shocked that Oliver Stone claims NO ONE DIED at FUKUSHIMA - WTF
320,Europe spent fourteen long years since the Bucharest declaration of 2008 playing Ukraine prevaricating delaying obfuscating Ukrainian entry into NATO. Western indecision has been tragic. As for Ukraine 'invading donbas' well it is Ukrainian sovereign territory any restoration of sovereignty is legitimate.
321,Scar face is as good as taxi driver you are hero you are a gentleman wonderful interlect good memory good historian I pray they don't slam the internet shut in in your face because it's our life line
322,Incredible interview. Thank you
323,"The fact that Oliver stone only thinks 6 people died as a result of Chernobyl is alarming. Not knocking nuclear energy, I support it. But come on...."
324,What a great interview
325,Josh Goldstein and his book on climate change. That‚Äôs all I need to hear from a ‚Äúrogue‚Äù like Oliver Stone.
326,Mr. Stone is completely detached from reality when it comes to Europe and it's relation to Russia although his work on covering what US is doing in many places in the world is second to none.
327,I'm so disappointed that Stone said Russia should not have invaded!
328,The problem with Oliver stone is not what he says. Its what he doesn't say. He doesn't answer direct questions.
329,"I've watched so many Lex Fridman podcast episodes, and suddenly today - i realized i have NOT yet subscribed!    The prompt -  ""Please thumbs up and subscribe""   Really works!"
330,"This is the most informative podcast I have ever seen.....so thanks to both of you. I've thought a lot about this situation in Ukraine and I have a theory. Oddly enough, I think it is being influenced by a ""higher authority"" and I believe that it is the beginning of the end of war. In addition to handling the Donbas region, my understanding is that areas that held munitions were heavily hit. I've also read that weapons producers are running low on them. I think that was what Vladimir Putin had in mind, once it was clear that the treaties and the talks were not changing the scenario. I believe that it has been and will continue to be true that the ones who are involved for the wrong types of reasons will find that their plans backfire on them. That's what happens when mindsets don't seek knowledge."
331,Awesome. Thanks so much.
332,"Wow, I'm shocked, the guy seems to be very Pro-Putin. He should ask himself if he could say stuff like that about his country if he was Russian and not be jailed?"
333,Blessed are the peacemakers ‚òÆÔ∏è Stupidity should be painful üíú
334,"In that interview with Putin, one question that struck me was when they were walking through the garden and Oliver asked Putin if he would lose a war against the United States and with out a pause he very confidently replied no - makes one wonder what Putin knows and what he has ."
335,"Lex Fridman, you are a great interviewer... your questions are well structured, thoughtfully framed and show great depth of understanding and relevance... 
i have spent my career asking questions (more than 30 years)...  not in public as you do but behind corporate walls.. asking the right questions, in relevance and understanding is the key to understanding everything about anything...
and our cultural programming prevents many intelligent beings from asking the right questions... 
you Sir, are a treasure
as is Oliver Stone"
336,"So glad to find this channel! Lex is a superb interviewer, simply the best. New subscriber."
337,"Lex has a certain apperceptive mass, as Oliver Stone does as well. One has to probe that dimension
of perception, to get at truth. Philosophers can do that. Apperceptive mass is outside of the individual
getting into himself. Or so I think. Apperceptive mass is the Other external to the true self inside self."
338,Who would ever thought we'd ever come to a two-tier Justice system.
339,Great interview. Thank you!
340,"My problem with Olivier Stone is that he suffers from some of the worst confirmation bias around, especially when it comes to history."
341,"People might die not immediately from nuclear accidents, but what are the effects of excess radiation?  This really needs to be studied & the facts revealed."
342,"Good interview, Lex. I imagine you had difficulty restraining yourself sometimes, but you stuck to a professional, controlled role. Your interview gave me some new perspectives to think about. It's always useful to be able to consider new perspectives."
343,I applaud Oliver on his candor and openness in this interview. What a pleasure to watch. Thanks Lex for bringing him on
344,"@10:20 the guy totally forgets that nuclear radiation lasts a long time and the area aroundChernobyl and Fukushima Dhahinchi is still uninhabitable. But hey, Stone read a book and now he's a damn genius, right?"
345,Stone snorted one too many lines‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI saw Russia media criticism‚Ä¶‚Äù now they are all dead‚Ä¶ ok Oliver.
346,Greetings from Saigon where I a person from New York City now 68 years old have been living half my life. Harking back to the logo of the New York World's Fair of 1964-65 which I remember enjoying as a child I humbly remind... Peace through understanding! When I was growing up... Vietnam was one of the more dangerous places to be. Now it is among the safest.
347,This interview is amazingly inspiring and very well made.
348,"Oliver Stone approached me on the NYSE floor and offered a spot in his movie, but I was taking a NY Inst of Finance exam for Wesleyan credit that night.  I harassed him loudly for his pony tail.  He was a good sport about it.  I clerked for Bear Stearns in the Blue Room in 1987."
349,Olivier Stone is LEGEND
350,We speak with fear here in U.S. as well.  Who would dare to speak in favor of Russia in a professional working environment these days?
351,"I found most of the stuff, specially when talking about Russia, delusional"
352,"downplaying chernobyls environmental and social/health impact is dangerous. I believe in nuclear energy's role in the world , but don't say 'only 50 people died'. Chernobyl was a global environmental disaster that's effects are still being felt accross Europe."
353,"Good one, Thanks!"
354,"Just subscribed, found you on Joe Rogan‚Äôs podcast. Respect! üòä‚úåÔ∏è"
355,"Yes to play devil‚Äôs advocate, fittingly - psychopaths are cool, calm, and collected. Yes they can also be rather charming, and fool many people. Of course there have been/are plenty in politics. I certainly don‚Äôt trust anyone in government/power, no matter how well they talk their talk and carry themselves. Always leave room for doubt, and question everything - especially with politics."
356,"I respect you Lex for this interview, it's a healthy to hear all sides perspectives."
357,Wow - this is one of the best interviews with Oliver Stone I've ever watched or listened to.
358,"Great interview, very interesting to listen to Oliver's points."
359,"Man pretty one sided view on things, just explain to Ukraine population and the ones who lost family that they deal with a calm and decent human being who is just sad about how U.S. treated him.. of course all his war crimes make sense now, he is not aggressive at all"
360,amazing interview.  I've never seen such an indepth conversation with Oliver Stone (who I admire greatly).  Superb job.
361,"Jesus Christ, Stone's senility has set in... 
His list of sovereign countries doesn't include Ukraine ü§î
Stone will be singing Trump's praises in a minute"
362,"1:39:00 It makes me think of how expedient winning an argument or 'gotchas' are when interviewing contentious or evil figures as opposed to seeking that fundamental conscience that drives them. If in 1941, someone was to try to truly understand Hitler in a televised interview, they would get branded a sympathiser or at the very least unhelpful yet this is the interview that would be most insightful to the human race and one in which every thinking person alive now wishes existed. We need far fewer antagonistic interviews and moral posturing if we, including the future generations, want to fully understand human nature and the events of our time. It remind me of Hannah Ardent''s quote 'to understand is not to forgive'. Well done for exhibiting this ideal Lex ."

364,"Wow, Oliver, wrong on all 10 counts!!    [time point 54.50}.     Must be a record.  You were wrong, wrong, wrong.  How can you think Putin could have been wrong on something so big, so important, needing so much thought, balance, information.  Remember next time an old saying ""if you disagree with someone who has access to much more information than you do,  it's probably that you are wrong"".    And in regard to being ""isolated from Europe"" does it occur to you that Russia doesn't care; doesn't' need these nations who have threatened them for over 400 yrs, , when she has access to entire rest of the world????   Putin wasn't wrong to go into Nazi Ukraine, which was building up troops on the border with Donbass {Russian} in the thousands, and had mucho mucho backing from CIA and America.   Remember something he said a while back ""50 yrs ago, the streets of Leningrad taught me one thing: if you see a fight is inevitable --- strike first""!!!    He did that in Chechnya, Georgia, Syria.  And it always works."
365,"Please Oliver Stone make a film 'Alexander the Great as King of Macedonia not Greece..."""
366,"Mr. Stone, I totally hear your thoughts and I admire your talent and brain. But what surprised me was that how freely, without fear and without pleasing the government of your country you can express your thoughts. Lot of people in Putin‚Äôs Russia or Kazakhstan can NOT afford the freedom and do NOT feel safe to speak freely or criticize their government."
367,"Come on, you and everyone else knows that nuclear accidents are covered up so, the actual numbers that had died are far greater than you say."
368,"Great interview, thanks"
369,"I've been lucky to discover your podcast from the very beginning, so I happily watched 95% of your episodes. Your open mind and curiosity are inspiring so thanks for evrything you do.

Unfortunately, during this episode it felt like I'm watching another Lex, who for some reason completely failed to challenge the guest and just let him go ahead with any claims that he made, putting dictator putin on a pedestal and talking in a very disrespectful manner about the Ukrainean citizens, among others (no, I'm not Ukrainean). He made some gross generalisation suggestion that the Ukrainean army is a far right extremist movement in a miserable attempt to discredit them while also suggesting that those war crimes that the Russian army commited are not what we think they are.  Also, if I just came from another planet, following him I'd think that Russia is heaven on earth while the US and Europe are authoritarian regimes where no one wants to leave. I guees that says a lot (just check how many independent newspapers and TV stations are left in Russia, for example) . I appreciate freedom of speech and of course he can say whatever lies he wants, but given the high standards that you set, Lex, and as a sign of respect towards your audience, it would have been nice to challenge his ""arguments"" and help us see the truth as it is not as some putin fan imagines it."
370,"22:52 Stone: ""Poland was always attacking Russia since I remember""_____ wow____ now that should be the clickbait of this episode Lex."
371,Stone 's analysis is spot on//THe Azov act with impunity..THey even provocated Poland 2019 having Bandera day in Lvov
372,Go Russia ! Love to the best leader in world -Putin is ! ‚ù§Ô∏è
373,Oliver Stone is a Cinema Titan
374,He is actually 100 percent correct about the efficiency to safety ratio advantage of nuclear energy. Especially concerning safety towards the environment. It‚Äôs not even close. It‚Äôs just scary to people but hopefully we get over it.
375,Fascinating. Brilliant. Stone is right about www.wikipedia.com slanting info or leaving info out.
376,"It's about time‚Ä¶ If we had continued developing thorium reactors in the 50s, we would not be in the climate mess we are in today."
377,Just one remark: there is a very good book about resource based wars & crimes by Dr. Daniele Ganser (from Switzerland). It's worth reading.... very factual...
378,We are in a totally different Era.  What Pitin has done is unacceptable.  I see Olivers points but we are dealing with a different generation and a different mindset. Nothing against the Russian people.  Most of the o es I encountered are very nice.
379,"oh man, this is that good trouble, i doubt the OTAN could like this choice you took of bringing oliver to talk. praises to you lex, you f¬¥¬¥¬¥¬¥¬¥ did it, you really went out the OTAN propaganda machine to look for the grey"
380,"Very good conversation about what IS REALLY going in the World today, I can't imagine why the USA and Russians can't start doing good for each other. WAR is so old.  Hats off off to both of you.  Very enjoyable listening. Many thanks!"
381,Oliver Stone for Russian ambassador in 2024!!!
382,"Excellent interview with Oliver,  so much to learn, thank you for your great questions LEX,  and what a great guest üëçüëçüëçüôè"
383,"Interesting paralels ‚Äì The citizens of countries neighboring Russia would cringe at many ideas that Oliver is presenting. It feels like Oliver's ideas are at a more Strategic level vs the Tactical level of the Russia's neighbors. 
And  it's so true that this ""Good"" vs ""Bad"" guys is so nuanced that there's barely a difference. One sees what one wants to see. As there is no lack of examples of Americans meddling in affairs of  other country states for the sake of ""freedom"".
Controversial ideas that provide additional context, but isn't it a feature of democracy to be ""flexible"" and start leaning towards ""autocracy"" when threats arise? That way existential decision can be made faster (for better or for worse)? Otherwise one could debate till the end of time is Putin a ""Bad"" or ""Good"" guy till the end of time? Of course the mechanism for reversion towards normal ""democracy"" takes a lot longer than ""autocracy""?"
384,He certainly looks like the richest man in the world as he walks down what looks like a mile long hallway with nobody else in it. As he sits 30 feet away from his closest advisors and government leaders.
385,"1:08:50 Also problems in all the former soviet union states like Kazakhstan for example, a situation made by Stalin by transportation of people and rewriting borders etc. So is Russia going to have wars with all its former satellite states?"
386,"I stopped watching as soon as it became apparent that Stone is still pushing the climate change alarmist line that Carbon Dioxide is a bad thing. Over the last 140 million years atmospheric carbon dioxide has decreased from 4000 ppm to something like 300 ppm, dangerously close to the 150 ppm survival threshold for all vegetation on earth; due to the continual burying, and locking in of, carbon bearing marine sediment. The slight carbon dioxide releases over the last century are hugely beneficial to life on earth and have helped to green the planet."
387,Oliver Stone is so right! But Putin? Russia?
388,Oliver stone has expressed his views of Putin clearly and concisely.  Great interview.
389,"If you're trying to work towards truth, reason, consensus on reality, reconciliation / connection / education, or you're like Lex here, and trying to just be better about the way you treat people when arguing or debating, I appreciate you.

This isn't an ad and I'm not doing this out of any personal gain; if everyone does well, and I'm part of everyone, that's good for me. So, that in mind, a couple of years back, I came across a fantastic resource for reaching out to people who believe things that are, simply, wrong. Beliefs born of emotion instead of logic or reality. YouTuber Anthony Magnabosco has a series he's titled ""Street Epistemology,"" where he displays conversations and commentary, showing how to help people question themselves, and help them reach the truth via their own efforts. He'll talk to people, on campuses for example, because he can follow up once or twice over the following weeks or months, having left his acquaintances to think on their own time for a while. It's incredible to see the long, silent pause in the conversation with Magnabosco, as they start to honestly ask themselves things that no debate or graph or consensus had yet been able to incite. He lets them know that he's recording, so we get to benefit from seeing people as they realize (for example) they've been clinging to ideas and beliefs, willfully ignoring overwhelming contrary evidence and / or a complete lack of any supporting... simply because they heard it from a trusted adult when they were little, or because they've reached a very brittle comfort from avoiding harsh realities of human life. These people can stop pursuing ideas and actions that are damaging our world and each other. They're better equipped to build a solid picture of their existence through unflinching analysis of their experiences, and evaluating those of others. They're left with an improved ability to handle hardships or conflicting ideas, as mere concepts or questions are no longer able to wreck a worldview they've created around baseless core beliefs. 

The way Americans used to treat prisoners of war was known far and wide, particularly when contrasted to, say, Soviet, German, or Japanese captors, during the 1930s and '40s. Soldiers heald tales, of how they'd have a better life as a US military prisoner than they would if they continued fighting for their own country. So notoriously cushy were the conditions of imprisoned enemy soldiers (again, relatively so), it inspired those soldiers to at least strongly consider surrender to American forces when going got tough and morale was low. Those famous post-war Soviet defections would never have naken place if the defectors thought they'd be worked or starved to death, between beatings. Anyone who knew about what happened to anyone who dared surrender to the Japanese, for example, would be best advised to fight like hell until either victory or death.

Frustrated though we all certainly are, we best serve our own interests by working to win people to our side. Sure, facts, reason, and logic are important, but we win the most people over by treating our adversaries with respect and dignity, answering questions with unflinching honesty, and, most importantly, relating on a personal level.

If we can form a relationship, we're no longer a faceless straw-man caricature, ripe for demonization and hatred.

If we are honest at all times, even if it shows our side in a negative light, people we've befriended can gain confidence that we will convey what we truly believe to be the truth about things they don't like, believe, or agree with. It's difficult and downright rude, at that point, for adversarial but mutually respectful parties to avoid giving some weight and consideration to each other's beliefs and arguments."
390,"Senhor Putin, seus camaradas e a R√∫ssia, s√£o Fodas."
391,"Oliver Stone is so naive. He thinks these autocrats are honest, good ordinary people. But they are good at charming and manipulating, and they have clearly charmed Stone."
392,"I  studied Geopolitics and European history for the better part of 40  years. I  love Oliver Stones films, and admire his work. But I  have to  say his political analysis is  heavily biased, and cannot be taken at its appearance, much as most things in  the public domain. But he talks like a verbose man and bordering naivete. I  lived both in the US, a while in Canada, Sweden and Norway. Now in Poland. And I  have little acceptance for  this brilliant mans analysis. Thank you  for  the films, though."
393,One question If Russia has so powerful weapons why are they even afraid of Nato? It does not make any sense at all!!!!
394,Would like to see him back on with somebody who has a better grasp of the Ukrainians side of things
395,"And again very interesting interview by Lex. Only one thing mr.Stone said and I complitly disagree is about ""tought"" UA censorship. I doubt he personally visited Ukraine after 2014. As an example, you may check on ""Anatoly Shariy"" story on wiki. And Medvedchuk, Oliver mentioned, openly criticised Poroshenko-Zelensky and had pretty successful pro Russian political party before 2022 war began"
396,Thank you for the research and films. But you are one of 81 million reasons why we are here now!
397,"I love Stone as a filmmaker but when he said only 50 humans have died from nuclear disaster, I question his logic. The scale of nuclear energy isn‚Äôt the same as fossil fuels and those numbers do not include long term affected by poisoning from radiation and cancer,a hard thing to prove. If it looks like shit and smells like shit, it probably is. Watch ‚ÄúThree Mile Island‚Äù. Stay for the end to find out if anybody dies from fallout."
398,This is one of the best open minded interviews ever....
399,life is a book that was made for all .lex your a interest to all. very well put to gather good luck in your life.
400,33:46 That adage applies much better to the American Empire and why they should not have the world reserve currency.
401,Sovereignty for single leader despots? Pound sand Oliver.
402,Awesome interview. Eye opening.
403,"Good interview but I find this chap an extraordinarily compromised individual. He‚Äôs really reading this all a bit oddly. It‚Äôs a very American centric view, but the idea we‚Äôve followed America like cattle in resisting Russia is ignoring several centuries of Russian imperialism. Our history, culture and collective mindset means Europe is and always has been cautious about Russian expansionism."
404,Stone is so willing to acquiesce to Putin‚Äôs version of events that he ends up being¬†viciously trolled. He says that Russia has free press and says that the RT news channel had marvelous and accurate news feed...
405,Where do I find this 4 hour interview with Putin? What's it called?
406,oliver stone sounds pretty much exactly like my grandfather (we are germans) when he explains why mr hitler invaded poland and chech republic. it is frightening how close it is
407,"Russia has had more intellects than ""McDonals."""
408,Saw Oliver Stone and new this would be awesome. Nuclear may not have killed many people at 0hr of the incidents but I can assure you the toll is a lot higher after the fact and not to mention the many many other negatives to the environment and health should be taken seriously and not just glossed over like that.
409,"The way Americans pronounce ""Putin"" is disastrous.  It generally comes out much better in British English (at least,  in what is considered standard British pronunciation.)"
410,"Thank you for hosting the amazing Oliver Stone, you're now on the ""Free Speech"" subscriber list.!"
411,Hitler didn't go after the british? what was the blitz of 1940 about and the battle of britain which he lost. the invasion barges that was gathering in france and that got called off when he lost the battle of britain. If Churchill was all about preserving the empire he would not have declared war after germany invades poland. This bloke is amazingly dense for a filmmaker.
412,REALLY REALLY .....ONE OF THE BEST INTERVIEWS I HAVE SEEN .......THANKS TO YOU BOTH....
413,God Bless and safe  thanks for great information
414,"Underscoring what Mr. Stone said about what makes a good interview, I've come to the realization that everyone simply wants to be heard, to be understood. Whether or not you agree with them or have a solution is secondary, primary is that they want to be heard, not to be invisible."
415,"Including renewables, we need to create the cleaner and safer forms of nuclear energy.  There are great ways of using nuclear energy and ways to avoid it."
416,Stone seemed to back Putin/ Russia more than I would expect. Interesting...
417,Yeah i like Elon musk too he's like a Ace and a hole for Twitter. We need a platform we can talk on without getting shut  completely down by left no doubt.
418,"And then Stone says:
.(paraphrasing)..' it's in the interest of Ukrainians to keep its civilans from escaping through the corridors'
 Stone does this:  he makes sense, he walks logically, and then:  BOOM! he drops a totally illogical, untrue statement/conclusion...
Oliver turns on the lights  ,(for which we thank him), but then comes to totally wrong conclusion..."
419,Asking a film maker about politics? How about my 7 yr old son too?
420,"But apart from the initial bit about nuclear power, the remainder was insane. With nuclear having nut cases like these on it's side, it's no wonder the world is in a mess"
421,"Turns out all those who wrote ""not positive"" articles were right about him. Surprise."
422,Brilliant episode!
423,"Very telling as well, regarding our Moderator;  rather than saying there is something about talking with a person who is telling the truth, our moderator said, there is something about talking with a ""man"" who is telling the truth."
424,"Hate to break it to you Lex, but if you can't draw a line between good and evil...people notwithstanding...you are too afraid to fight for what you believe in."
425,so it was the US the whole time. Damn it they got us again
426,Brilliant!!!
427,"Oliver Stone every word, speeches, interviews is so powerful to whole world  his knowledge, experience  is very important in these times !"
428,"Would be very interesting to have Kasparov on, then Kasparov and Oliver stone on at the same time. It's important to give people their chance to speak but it's also important to have a debate."
429,"The simple fact that this video has 30% down votes shows the importance of Oliver Stone. Americans just do not like to be told they are not an honest power, that they do evil for their own self gains - as other nations do. They are told daily they are the best and do not like to be reminded they are a deeply flawed nation. Honest conversations must be told regardless of your feelings."
430,Can anybody substantiate Stone‚Äôs claims that Ukraine was amassing troops near the Donbas region prior to the Russian Invasion?
431,Oliver stone talks to a russian secret agent üòÑ
432,Thank you Lex for doing this interview. I so wish we had more people like Oliver Stone who understands the world in a practical way and sees the world the way it actually is and not a painted picture from the media. Semper Fi Oliver!
433,"He is attacking american imperialism and then proceeds to defend russian imperialism. 
Integrity."
434,One of the best interviews
435,Oliver Stone's a standup individual.
436,It's amazing how someone like Oliver voted for Biden because he feared Trump. You'd think being so well informed on Putin's demonization by the west would have given him some perspective.
437,"Everytime Oliver says something negative of USA, there is no followup questions from Lex. Joe Rogan would not have done that. Maybe it's because Lex is not from US so he doesn't want to look too much in opposition."

440,"First time here, I just watched the first five minutes and I already think this is going to be a great interview! Thank you for your work. Cheers."
441,"This is such an insanely bizarre interview... very bizarre. I mean at some point you have to look back and re-evaluate things from a different point of view?

Oh so Russia deserves sovereignty, as does China; good, good, i can live with that. But Georgia does not? Moldova? Ukraine? Baltic? Poland? Or do only big and powerful countries deserve sovereignty? I think your value is not how you deal with the big ones, because you pretty much have to take them into account, but whether you throw the little ones under the bus.

When he describes McCain as sneering as Putin speaks in 2007, how is it necessarily about USA? What if the guy understands that this is manipulation; that USA or NATO can do nothing to Russia, the nuclear retaliation threat is too serious; but that Russia can seriously mess up its neighbours and is potentially looking for an excuse?

When he describes Putin as... an opposite of communist... well communism never existed in USSR according to some scholars; that it was a single capitalist monopoly instead. And Putin right at the start, he called up all oligarchs and made them an offer they couldn't refuse, he re-created a large chunk of this system after it was gone and buried.

And to suggest that Musk is entirely honest, that he will bring freedom of speech to Twitter? Almost ridiculous. Is a person who believes everyone, takes them exactly at their word, cut out to be acting in journalistic capacity at all?"
442,Thank you Lex for allowing a point of view that may not be easy for many of your regular viewers.
443,"What's with the facts, knowledge of history, and analysis?  I thought the real way to the truth is to have really strong emotions based on selectively edited video and editorialized presentation of information, C'mon guys"
444,I love Oliver Stone‚Äôs melodic voice
445,"As Ukrainian it was extremely difficult to watch this interview . White people playing liberals deciding what to do or not to do with my country. Ukrainian people are not even asked.
It is we who are make choice, we are putting our lives to defend land, belives  and our philosophy. In this context whitewashing Putin and russia is just fucking outrageous. 
Our future and progress being suppressed by our ‚Äúparter‚Äù for 18 years now. This shit ‚Äúwho‚Äôs bad who‚Äôs good‚Äù is never ending process. And talking with russia is now not an option, Ukrainians will make sure of that"
446,"Hard to continue listening after the statement that 50 people died in Chernobyl. Those are the direct deaths after the explosion and it is a gross misrepresentation of the long shadow of radiation. It is a silent killer and takes years to manifest, depending on the exposure doses. Hundrends of thousands of people were exposed to it. I'm all for discussing the merits of nuclear energy, less of a fan of overt manipulation."
447,"It would be worth mentioning that his son works in the ""pretty good"" Russia Today."
448,Amazing how the whole carbon con game started with striking  coal miners in England
449,"Asking Oliver Stone to weigh in on complex political topics would be like seeking out George Lucas to weigh in on complex topics in real scientific questions arising in the biology of humans and potential humanoid species.  The only difference is George Lucas would tell you he‚Äôs unqualified, and want to talk about something else.  What a joke.  Worst interview Lex has ever done here and the most dangerous, because it masquerades well to the naive as someone who has expertise on a subject they know little about."
450,Brilliant!
451,"Try to setup an interview with navalny or some ruzzian dissidents

And talking about energy dont forget the gas in the ground of donbass in ukraine"

457,Lex is definitely right about being able to tell when a man is speaking freely. I'm sure he can pick up when Mr. Stone here stops speaking freely. Just before giving up too much information about who really started this war.
458,I honestly did not know Oliver Stone is this deep about world poliics. The guy sounds like a statesman
459,Oliver Stone seems to have a unique perspective that seems to ring true with respect to Putin.
460,Not the  greatest story ever told :)
461,"One of your best interviews, if not the best."
462,What a brilliant interview!
463,"Stone‚Äôs Initial Take on Russia‚Äôs Invasion of Ukraine
Stone had a harsher critique against Putin in a March 2022 Facebook post, in which he
had the following to say about Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine:
‚ÄúAlthough the United States has many wars of aggression on its conscience, it
doesn‚Äôt justify Mr. Putin‚Äôs aggression in Ukraine. A dozen wrongs don‚Äôt make a
right. Russia was wrong to invade. It has made too many mistakes:
1) underestimating Ukrainian resistance
2) overestimating the military‚Äôs ability to achieve its objective
 
3) underestimating Europe‚Äôs reaction, especially Germany upping its military
contribution to NATO, which they‚Äôve resisted for some 20 years; even Switzerland
has joined the cause. Russia will be more isolated than ever from the West
4) underestimating the enhanced power of NATO, which will now put more pressure
on Russia‚Äôs borders
5) probably putting Ukraine into NATO
6) underestimating the damage to its own economy and certainly creating more
internal resistance in Russia
7) creating a major readjustment of power in its oligarch class
8) putting cluster and vacuum bombs into play
9) and underestimating the power of social media worldwide
But we must wonder, how could Putin have saved the Russian-speaking people
of Donetsk and Luhansk?
No doubt his Government could‚Äôve done a better job of showing the world the
eight years of suffering of those people and their refugees ‚Äî as well as
highlighting the Ukrainian buildup of 110,000 soldiers on the Donetsk-Luhansk
borders, which was occurring essentially before the Russian buildup. But the
West has far stronger public relations than the Russians.
Or perhaps Putin should‚Äôve surrendered the two holdout provinces and offered
1-3 million people help to relocate in Russia. The world might‚Äôve understood
better the aggression of the Ukrainian Government. But then again, I‚Äôm not sure.
But now, it‚Äôs too late. Putin has allowed himself to be baited and fallen into the
trap set by the U.S. and has committed his military, empowering the worst
conclusions the West can make. He probably, I think, has given up on the West,
and this brings us closer than ever to a Final Confrontation. There seems to be
no road back.
The only ones happy about this are Russian nationalists and the legion of
Russian haters, who finally got what they‚Äôve been dreaming of for years, i.e.
Biden, Pentagon, CIA, EU, NATO, mainstream media ‚Äî and don‚Äôt overlook
Nuland and her sinister neocon gang in D.C. This will significantly vindicate the
uber hawks in public eyes.
Pointing out the toxicity of their policies (Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya,
Syria, NATO expansion, breaking nuclear treaties, censoring and omitting
crucial facts from the news, etc.) will be next to impossible. Pointing out
Western double standards, including Kyiv and Zelenskyy‚Äôs bad behavior, will
likewise fall on deaf ears as we again draw the wrong conclusions.
It‚Äôs easier now to smear those of us who tried to understand the Russian
position through these last two decades. We tried. But now is the time, as JFK
and Khrushchev faced down the perilous situation in Cuba in October 1962, for
the two nuclear powers to walk this back from the abyss. Both sides need to
save face.
This isn‚Äôt a moment for the U.S. to gloat. As a Vietnam War veteran and as a
man who‚Äôs witnessed the endless antagonism of the Cold War, demonizing and
humiliating foreign leaders is not a policy that can succeed. It only makes the
situation worse. Back-channel negotiations are necessary, because whatever
happens in the next few days or weeks, the specter of a final war must be
realistically accepted and brokered.
Who can do that? Are there real statesmen among us? Perhaps, I pray, Macron.
Bring us the likes of Metternich, Talleyrand, Averell Harriman, George Shultz,
James Baker, and Mikhail Gorbachev.
The great unseen tragedy at the heart of this history of our times is the loss of a
true peaceful partnership between Russia and the U.S. ‚Äî with, yes, potentially
China, no reason why not except America‚Äôs desire for dominance.
The idiots who kept provoking Russia after the Cold War ended in 1991 have
committed a terrible crime against humanity and the future. Together, our
countries could‚Äôve been natural allies in the biggest battle of all against climate
change.
In its technical achievements alone, in large scale science, in its rocketry, heavy
industries, and its most modern, clean nuclear energy reactors, Russia has been
a great friend to man. Alas, in our century so far, man has failed to see or reach
for the stars.‚Äù
How Does He See It Now?
Now, two months later, how does he feel about the situation? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very hard to be honest
about this because the West has brought down a curtain. Anyone who questions the
invasion of Ukraine and its consequences is an enemy of the people,‚Äù Stone replies. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve
never in my lifetime seen such a WALL of propaganda as I‚Äôve seen in the West.‚Äù
And, the way European countries are jumping in with NATO suggests they do not, in fact,
have sovereignty over their own countries, Stone says. Why hasn‚Äôt NATO objected to the
massacres taking place in the Donbas region of Ukraine ever since 2014, when Ukraine
under Poroshenko took an anti-Russian position as an ally of the United States?
There were death squads, local leadership were being murdered, as were journalists. An
estimated 14,000 Ukrainian Russians were killed between 2014 and early 2022 by the
Ukrainian military and Nazi battalions, and the U.S. has supported it, and continues to
do so.
Stone claims the logs of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
Special Monitoring Mission in Ukraine show that before Russia‚Äôs ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù of Ukraine,
February 24, 2022, there was heavy artillery coming into the Donbas from the Ukrainian
side. According to Russia‚Äôs Foreign Ministry, Moscow‚Äôs action against Ukraine was a
‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù to end the ‚Äúsystematic extermination of the Donbas
population.‚Äù
 
 
We cannot analyze the Russian invasion of Ukraine
without taking the Donbas conflict, which has been
ongoing since 2014, into account.‚Äù
Ukrainian forces had built up on the border, and Stone believes Ukraine was actually
planning to invade Donbas. Russia then responded by sending forces to the border, but
this buildup on both sides has been largely ignored by Western media, which portrayed it
as a sudden and unprovoked invasion by Russia.
In other words, we cannot analyze the Russian invasion of Ukraine without taking the
Donbas conflict, which has been ongoing since 2014, into account. Stone is convinced
that Poroshenko was instructed, from the start of his presidency, to refuse negotiations
with Russia, and to maintain a hostile stance.
‚ÄúThis is very, very dangerous,‚Äù Stone says. Zelensky, also, has maintained this stance
since 2019. ‚ÄúThe whole world is being hurt by this, and no one is calling it out.‚Äù
Stone believes Putin realized that the U.S. is intent on regime change in Russia, and are
willing to destroy Ukraine to do it. So, he took action. Fridman suggests the Ukraine
conflict may in reality be a proxy war between Russia and the U.S., and Stone seems to
agree with this theory. But that still doesn‚Äôt give us any greater insight into this war.
Putin could have surrendered the Donbas and offered safe harbor for the refugees. He
chose not to, but why we don‚Äôt know.
Whatever the reason, Stone is convinced that it was a calculated move ‚Äî and not one
based on the misuse of power. He also points out that Zelensky had mentioned bringing
in nuclear weapons into Ukraine shortly before Russia‚Äôs invasion, which could have set
off alarms and influenced Putin‚Äôs decisions.
Stone also warns that the U.S. is more than capable of a nuclear and/or chemical false
flag. A small nuclear device could be set off in the Donbas, and even if it didn‚Äôt make
sense, the propaganda machine would automatically blame it on Russia. Of course,
Russia also has a significant nuclear arsenal, which could be brought to the fore.
‚ÄúCan we walk back from the brink of nuclear war?‚Äù Fridman asks. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Stone replies.
‚ÄúWhat do we need to walk it back?‚Äù Stone replies:
‚ÄúReason. Reason, and then diplomacy. Talk to the guy. Mr. Biden, why don‚Äôt you
calm down and go talk to Mr. Putin in Moscow. And try to have a discussion
without falling into ideologies"
464,"With all due respect to Mr. Stone.... Chernobyl killed a lot more than the official total of 31. Just considering the clean up crews, about 120,000 died by 2005. Cancer rates up. Etc, etc..."
465,listen  this  man  was  actually   their  and  lived  these  things  so  his  testimony  must  be  authentic  it  dont  seem  like  propaganda  it  sounds  legit  what  a  great  story
466,As an Australian I have a few questions . The press  basically had this war on front page /T.V.  in Feb 2022 yet it was going since 2014 so why the 8 year gap ?also what has been happening in these 8 years ?  Why did Valenki go to America in 2019 and ask Trump for military aid ? remember the Quid Pro Quo response. Truth as usual seems to be lost in the fog of this stupid unnecessary war .
467,"I heard Lots of love for Vlad!  So it'll take a while for the shock to wear off. None too kind to the Ukrainians either And why i follow multiple sources and refuse to settle on any opinions.
Peace ain't profitable that we can probably agree on though. BTW: I heard no evidence just shade being cast."
468,It is people like lex fridman that gives me a better understanding on the human race and that we dont have to resort to violence üôè

471,"If I could talk to Putin right now, I would congratulate him but also I would want to know, ""Why did the liberation take EIGHT YEARS to initiate?"""
472,Oliver Stone der beste Mann der die Wahrheit spricht
473,"There is interesting concept and observation that directors can present themselves very humble, well educated, polite to foreigners. For own people they are directors, monsters. That trap that Mr. Stone got into."
474,"When I was 20 years old I got addicted to WW2 could not stop reading as many books as possible. I started reading biographies on Adolph Hitler, around my 5th or 6th I was upset that I had not gotten any new information from what I had learned in the 1st. A regurgitation by different authors & publishers. Until I found Hitler's War by David Irving... Search for books written about Hitler before the War started! Pre 1939, see what they was saying then."

477,Freedom of the press is valued more than Integrity in the press.
478,"Good interview. While Oliver Stone does an admirable job at reaching out for the truth from his particular angle he does fall into the same traps of deductive reasoning as the voices he criticizes, i.e. he makes fundamental assumptions about the imperialist nature of the US and then deduces that certain policies must be examples of those policies. Example, he contests that the Western media portrays Russia and Putin as synonymous and as singular bodies. In his characterization of US foreign policy as quasi-imperialist, he describes the United States in pretty much the same kind of homogenous and singular body, when in fact power structures in a country like the US are inherently more multidimensional as they appear to be in an autocratically-run state such as Russia. In other words, his arguments are driven primarily by ideology to which he then arranges his interpretation of events."
479,Thank You Putin! üôèüíï
480,"Fantastic interview, thanks a lot! Being Russian living in Russia within all this mess happened i found it very enlightening. Really thanks to both - the guest and the interviewer! In the very beginning of the war i was totally and absolutely against it. Also i never voted Putin, coz of his inner politics. Still my heart is aching and I deeply regret about all the poor civil people who's suffering. But deep research of the roots of the conflict and this topic in general (what's important i don't have TV at all for many years and as historian i used neither Russian nor Ukrainian sources to avoid prejudgement, but only foreign independent sources, eng., french, italian etc.) bit by bit changed my mind... maybe unfortunately... but now I can't ignore all that i saw... all of this is purely invented political game against Russia and Russians for many many decades... And poor Ukraine was just an exchanging coin in this mean game... Zelensky became president, coz promised to establish peace with Russia, but who ever allowed him to do it? Anyway I hope it will end soon... Ukrainians I consider as brothers no matter what... I want them to become free of US agenda, and to find their true independence... coz the west never truly cared about them as they never cared about us... And now after all those tear-squeezing slogans, they already limited the support for the Ukrainian refugees...  No free transport, no free of charge staying in hotels, even no entrance to shops in Poland for ex.. Where's all that promises for Ukrainians to be admitted in Nato they so much hoped for?... It will never happen! Do not want even to comment this hypocrisy... Only hope that finally it will be peace between our nations, even though US wants the opposite."
481,"The first time I saw the Unipower World Policeman policy idea, was in the Rothschild Economist Magazine."
482,Wonderful to have different perspectives from the same old Establishment Corporate View of the World!!
483,"This episode taught me that no matter what country/culture we derive from, we are all exposed to lesser or greater degree of propaganda, which we have to be aware of and navigate in"
484,"Yeah, maybe Russians could have changed Putin, as Mr. Stone claims, but bad things keep happening to opposition leaders, journalists and activists."
485,Ask him his thoughts on Jim Morrison  next time pls.
486,Stone has a lot of knowledge poring out but it all seems rambling and disconnected and his conclusions about Putin and Ukraine are inane.
487,"Don't forget about the fact 
Which country is only capable of recharging nuclear batteries....
In fact it's Russia"
488,Oliver Stone and also his son are someone worth listening to and watching their films.
489,Happy that Musk has chosen to go Republican. He sounds Independent like me.
490,this guy has no idea how Putin thinks or how the old active measures work on what high time frame they think on. I'm ashamed stone  is very intelligent but fell into the trap...
491,"28:10 WTH? Nah, Putin was not a communist, he was just a staunch KGB man. and 28:48 Putin making a point of sovereignty for everyone~?...BUT, Ukraine~! There are too many  dimensions to Putin and his history to capture like this. May I suggest Frontline's ""Putin - Road to War"" for a wider (albeit, maybe not full) perspective?"
492,Absolutely great interview. I watched all the Oliver stone Putin interviews. How can anyone be so ignorant to take sides without ever listening to putin for a minute?
493,"Great unbias video, thank you Lex and Oliver for being so open minded and informative"
494,I would just looooove to see an Oliver Stone documentary about Bill Gates..
495,"USA deployed nuclear weapons in Europe since 1980 at Germany RFD, using Torrejon AFB, Spain, and after that never stopped increasing building up threat over Europe. Even the BREXIT was another US operation to make another step toward wars in Europe.
But technology changes and now Russia is not the comunist country, it is the Upper Hand, and USA lost the number 1.
World must Negociate Peace or Rest in Peace."
496,"I would value the opinion of an average person who has lived in either Russia or one of the other governments mentioned and had to maintain themselves and then lived on the other side over Oliver. It‚Äôs very different sir, interacting in presidential offices and being shown the facade, no objective opinion can be formed then. Much respect to Oliver but he seems very far from objectivity."
497,"Can't really blame Ukraine for not wanting to be ""neautral"" since your naighbour annex your territory. Usually bad feeling occur"
498,"For Stone is clear that people respect them cause he works for interests of russia... He really travel by russia, or just visit rich putin's residencies?"
499,good job thanks
500,fascinating!
501,Surprised with such poor kremlins propaganda here. Thanks for the video.
502,"Thank you lex, it's refreshing to Find a platform where information can be heard, real information. For a lot of people on here, this may be the 1st time that they've heard something other than what the Western media has been spreading. Knowledge is power. It's irresponsible for all these people to just say I stand with you Crane, without knowing what Ukraine stands for. I stand for the innocent."
503,"Interesting insights and alternate points of view.  I'm always open to the other side of the story.  The only problem for me is that when you consider all the bullshit Stone sprinkles in with facts in some of his movies, I find myself being guarded about whether I can really believe some of his insights.  He's a film director, after all--not an academic."
504,Unbelievable! Is Stone for real?
505,"16:21 ""I can't really speak honestly of ukraine"" ...mfr you made 2 documentaries lying about the country. WE KNOW."
506,"Good voice,cadence,knowledge,composer,understanding the iformation exspose or presented,Ive folled for years now,good job."
507,Scarface is a film by Brian de Palma. Oliver Stone did the screenplay
508,I think Putin's timing was spot on.
509,"He might be not, but Oliver sounds like the greatest KGB agent. He can pursue you in anything. Even if in one sentence he contradicts the previous one. Respect to Lex for having nerves to take it all in and be silent. Cause I wont."
510,"I have backed Oliver for ever, I love his films but I think he may well have finally lost the plot. So sad..... No mention of Navalny..."
511,"While I don't agree with Mr. Stone on much, except that Nuclear Energy is the future (or it should be), this was a great watch. Civil dialog and mature conversations are essential for the survival of our way of life. Finding compromise and common ground by way of civil discourse!"
512,"Oliver Stone's inability to express the truth that multiple things can be true at the same time is disheartening and disappointing. He is stuck in the 1960s counter cultural mindset. As in all things: there are arguments that contextualize Russian foreign policy and Putin's actions as something other than a cartoonish foil to the West. However, Oliver choses instead to go the opposite:  naively venerating Putin as some cartoon man: a mystic warrior monk of the Russian people, using Russian propaganda to cite his claims. 

Ironically, Oliver cites George Orwell's novel 1984 multiple times in his attack on Western Media all the while through the interview he uses the same big brother obfuscation to dither from speaking to Russian policy as it actually exists, but instead on what he wants it - and the Russian state - wants it be presented as. 

Despite Olivers long dithering to defend Russia, all he had to say was Putin is fighting for Russian interests within a specific historical and cultural context. Russia has a view and a destiny outside of the west which he wants to enact. Some of these interests involve delusions, greed, desire for power etc. The United States also has interests some of these interests involve delusions, greed, desire for power etc. The difference is he clearly could not contain his loathing for the United States as a country or as a power, and he could not contain his joy at propping up a false representation of the current social, economic, and foreign policy of Russian power. 

I would recommend if anyone is interested in understanding this point of view of the ""usful idiot"" to listen to Yuri Bezmenov. A man with his own bias to be sure, but still offers more context that Oliver when observing Russian foreign policy and cold war history."
513,"funny how every other youtube video where people say the same things as Mr. Stone, and their video are gone so fast its incredible"
514,Thank you brilliant interview üôèüáÆüá™
515,Its just incredible how this man fell for Putin and is taking his own speculations for reality
516,"This episode made me doubt some of my previous beliefs about Russia and Putin. However, it bothers me that Oliver Stone has only good things to say about Putin and Russia, not a single criticism or doubt, and only bad things to say about Ukraine and Zelenskyy.

‚ÄúOnly a Sith deals in absolutes.‚Äù - Obi-Wan Kenobi"
517,‚ÄúPoland has always been attacking Russia‚Ä¶the two world wars that occupied Russia so tragically ‚Ä¶Russia was attacked through Poland and Ukraine‚Äù.  This guy is a Russian asset.
518,"Very interesting expression of his opinion. But putting away the fact that it is the 5th war Russia started during the last ~20 years (Chechnya I & II, South Ossetia, Abkhazia, Crimea) stating  ""Putin is protecting Russia"" and blame for everything the USA  I do consider as an ""exaggeration"".  There is a long history of Russia when ""normalizing"" the situation with blood and weapons  in its influence zone (like in Hungary 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968,  Poland in 1981). No question the USA is forcing its ""theory"" on a strong - many times on a violent - way I've never backed consider that aggression as well.
I think that statement ""Putin isn't a communist"" is a mistake as well. Independently what kind of a ""library"" is behind them on the wall to point to (I mean books written by Lenin, Marx or Engels alternatively  Nietzsche's  or Hitler's)  these ""rulers"" are exerting their power on the same way following the same theory - ""stay in power"".  
Not talking about none of them ever had read any of those books by my opinion. Well except Hitler who was writing one of those ""guides"" - so he had to read it.  Minor differences we call the camps ""Gulag"" or ""KZ"" or ""filtration camps"" - no difference by my opinion.
Looking at those terrifying pictures from children gardens with new-born kids in uniform,  celebrations with brainwashed young boys in military march, everyday injected hatred against whoever, looking at the ""PutinJugend' formed exactly on the way the German Nazis were doing with the Hitlerjugend - we have to say since 2000 Russia militarized its people ready to kill ""women and kids"" as A. Hitler was shouting that in Nurenberg before starting WWII."
519,He offers a mix of good info and obvious bias at the same time. The Elon nuclear battery comment really highlighted his short comings.
520,"Lex, you are a very patient person.  I could only get through half of this interview because every time you asked Oliver a question he had the same answer no matter what you asked.... 'the West and America are bad, blah blah blah...' I can respect his opinion on the West, but that's the only answer he gave for every question."
521,democracy nowadays is like two wolves and a sheep deciding on dinner choice.
522,"The ""50"" deaths at Chernobyl is  a ridiculously low figure"
523,"I agree that people should try to understand each others motives without screaming and shouting. But... I am getting a sense that Mr Stone is taking what Putin says as face value, as if its true undeniably, as if there is no lie or distorted truth."
524,Anyone here praying for Ukraine? Glory to the Motherland.
525,My favorite guest yet
526,"It seems to me that Stone just can‚Äôt allow two simultaneous truths. Regardless, I don‚Äôt understand his apparently naive view of a ruthless dictator. Him of all people, I would have thought, would instinctively distrust/loathe a character like Putin. Very curious."
527,In terms of energy I say river bed generators. Every big town lies on a river. Rivers flowing 24/7 not like wind or photovoltaic. And the power of water is so much higher. The energy problem is solved since decades. But a generator is simple and can be used bye everyone. So the industry is fighting against it.
528,Starting from the war in Ukraine you lost me Mr. Stone. Too much speculation and disregarding too many facts.
529,"""My adolescence in the streets of Saint-Petersburg taught me that if the fight is inevitable, it is better to hit first"" V. Poutine"
530,"Always appreciate your work Lex, but how bizarre Stone's depiction of Putin's character. I don't get it. The guy's a mass murderer. Wild."
531,Putin has been interviewed dozens of times ..Why are'n the representatives of the US and the EU interviewed like they do with Putin?? they have more thing to explain than Putin
532,"Ha, ha, Oliver's defense of Vlad, like his defense of nuclear power, like his abuse of ""environmentalists"" tells.  Respect of the claim of Russian ""manifest destiny"" is poppycock. Ha, ha, what a fervent elitist. He sure pushes your aspiration to rule buttons.ü§£"
533,lets start the interview with a misnomer about climate change to let all the real intellects know your about to piss down our leg. Thanks! I am out
534,"Can someone make sense of Stone's theory about how just saying ""they're going to invade"" over and over again actually makes them do it?????? 59:30"
535,"""Poland has been always attacking Russia"" I would expect Mr Stone to know history better. When Hitler attacked Poland on September  1, 1939, Russia attacked Poland from the other side on September 17, 1939. He blindly assumes one sided perspective. American imperialism is bad, but Russia's imperialism we have to understand.."
536,"Superb, thank you very much for such a great conversation."
537,"I met an 87 year old Ukrainian immigrant the other day.  He came here to California from Odessa 30 years ago. We worked as election volunteers together in Los Angeles. He spoke Russian much better than English. When asked how he felt about the conflict, he stated he didn't like what Zelinsky was doing.  He grew up in the USSR and always identified as Russian.  He's also Jewish, but identifies first as Russian. He said he understands why Russia felt threatened.  He's very aware of fascism in Ukraine."
538,"I have nothing but admiration for the Russian people. But Stone does not acknowledge the Gulags and oppression of the Soviet State. There is a reason why Lex lives in the US. Blinders do not help in understanding. 
And yes, I have visited both Russia and Ukraine when they were the Communist state. The people were wonderful. But you could tell there was a caution on the part of the lntourist guides as to what they would say.
Stone strikes me as one who glommed on to his beliefs decades ago, and never re-examined them. The Venona Papers, released from the Archives of the KGB, substantiate McCarthy and show that the Rosenbergs and others were working against the US. Other defectors testified regarding disinformation strategies to sow and fund discord, including the movements of the 60s. Stone undermines some of his own contributions to better relations with the Russians by his own na√Øvet√©."
539,"However, amaizing episode"
540,"It‚Äôs nice to know we can still listen to a well traveled, well read man and make up our own minds. ‚ÄúThe west has brought down a curtain‚Äù I‚Äôm sure utube defunded this interview though."
541,"Oliver Stone.. isn't that that ""natural born killers"" guy? and the dude that just snatched a netflix title for its own ""documentary"" about Ukraine? (netflix: winter on fire, his 'documentary': ukraine on fire, the netflix documentary goes back just a little bit further back in time which is crucial to understand the conflict prior to the war there)"
542,Oliver Stone in Donbas. That‚Äôs a short film I‚Äôd love to see.
543,"I don't agree with a lot of comments below.  I've enjoyed a lot of Oliver Stone films.  He's definitely an interesting guy.  However he seems to have taken leave of his senses.  That said he's a great advert for American democracy, freedom and free speech .... because in most of the countries he so admires he'd be in fairly hot water if he went around trashing them.  Also he so admires Kennedy ..... wow ..... I get the feeling he's trapped in the summer of 1963 ....... Amongst other things he claims in this podcast ....... if Kennedy had survived, the Cold War probably wouldn't have happened ...... the US might detonate a nuclear device in Donbas as a 'false flag' operation ........ if only Biden would have a friendly chat with Putin without all that nasty anti-Putin bias a lot of the current troubles could be sorted ...... Putin is a great guy and far more interesting than any US President (other than JFK obviously).  I'm loving the Lex Fridman podcast.  Was tipped off to it by Hugh Hendry.  Keep up the excellent work Lex."
544,Disappointing that Stone doesn‚Äôt talk about new types of nuclear tech designed with inherent safety principles.  Instead he sounds like he‚Äôs defending any old kind of reactor.  Thought being informed was his business.
545,Churchill proposed a deal to hitler in 38??? Churchill wasnt even PM in 38
546,What about the wild propaganda that overweening Zelensky is some comic roly poly man-of-the-people. The dude has a law degree. His daddy is a mining services expert - a professor - head of the state university‚Äôs cybernetics tool automation department. His mommy is an engineer. Zelensky is as cold and calculating as any lawyer. He has nothing in common with commoners.

548,Awesome interview !!!
549,"i think the argument that ""nobody died in fukushima hence the danger of nuclear power is only a myth"" is kind of alienating to me knowing that the burning elements in that particular incident ate itself into the ground poisoning the whole surrounding area and oceanic streams with insanely high radiation that is carried around the globe.

or did they in the meantime find a way to contain the radiation spread?"
550,I don‚Äôt think Oliver was objective 100% that being said I also think Putin acts for Russia.  Just as a killer but that‚Äôs Russia‚Äôs problem
551,How beautiful introduction...
552,"Stone keeps saying ""neoconservatives"" but actually means ""neoliberals"".."
553,"5:00 ""build more reactors"" yeah, cool, and how are you going to feed them? becase there is also a peak in uranium production (and other fisible products). The way we get energy is not the problem. The problem is that we are trying to grow the energy consumption ad infinitum. That is physically not posible."
554,"That was so interesting especially a totally different view of V Putin.
Thank you both so much."

556,"He brings up tangential points particularly Finlandization that undermine his argument. You really think appeasing Russia is more freedom than joining NATO?

Putin doesn‚Äôt have charisma? Seriously.

He‚Äôs very na√Øve. I agree with many aspects of his argument but he is clearly ideologically partisan to Russia while under the impression that he is impartial and he seems cognitively dissonant to this."
557,"Protect Crimea is the main reason for intervention! Putin can't give up on Crimea and after Dombass, Crimea would have been the next step for the Ukrainien army!"
558,"To me this conversation was strange, O. Stone seemed nervous and worn out. The interviewer stiff, and mysterious dark, unreadable about his stance to the discussed topics. 
And l could not connect to their views on the Ukrainian matter. And certainly, a Biden-Putin table talk, would not save the world, as Biden is incapable to any diplomatic, compromising act. As no one in the West, especially Mr Biden, took the Minsk agreement for one second seriously.  

How intelligent/educated/ skilled people like Mr O. Stone can vote for a Mr Biden, and speak about Mr Putin‚Äôs, Russian‚Äôs mistakes, and not mention all the mistakes, and bloody wars against humanity by every US President, and it‚Äôs administration carried out, is an enigma to me. 
The biggest danger in our world is the USA. 

I am disappointed at the end, despite it was quite fascinating for awhile. But l am back now to Alexander Mercouris, The New Atlas, Galloway, Grayzone, Scott Ritter, Lancaster, Lira, Medhurst, and the rest of the mop opposing the Western anti Russian, anti Chinese propaganda.üá¶üá∫üïäüá®üá≥üá∑üá∫üïä"
559,"Listen to Stone before Kotkin and wow, a three time Oscar winner! Listen to Stone after Kotkin and wow, they will give an Oscar to anyone..."
560,Long Live Russia and Putin!!!!!!
561,"How do you have a conversation about Putin's decision to invade Ukraine, without discussing the issue of alignment with China in the face of Western imperialism? Stone talks geopolitics, minus geopolitics."
562,"Great man Oliver Stone, very decided keeping his line and the young man trying to change the interview into the ""Putin madness"" even then he presented a direction of inpartielity and truth..... Great man, thanks to Oliver Stone..."
563,I agree with Oliver Stone. Intelligent man.
564,Is the war in Ukraine like the Spanish civil war fought in 1936 -1939. There were international combattants and support
565,Oh dear.....how disappointing.......Oliver Stone has swallowed the CO2 nonsense about global warming or is  not what he purports to be. CO2 is the gas of life and is at lows on a geological timeline. We need more of it not less. Stopped bothering with this interview after it became clear that he doesn't understand his subject any more than most other people off the street.
566,"great talk, I like the way to listen calmly the answers to the smart questions, but Oliver Stone doesn't have so much his facts straights..."
567,What a fantastic interview.
568,Trump had experienced the same level of united negative propanganda as Putin.
569,"So we don't have to be concerned with nuclear waste?   The 'advanced' Russian way with Chernobl is what we have to look forward to?  So our faulty human memories will be perfected?  We can program our computers to remind our faulty human brains if, in the intervening thousands and thousands of years, a mouse hasn't screwed things up."
570,"A finn here. Stone is surprised how quickly Finland and Sweden ""fell into Nato basket"". Could it be that we have balanced on that curved sword for decades, done our very best to support and understand Russia as they are our neighbor. But enough is enough. Russia does not change for the better. So we cannot trust them anymore, that trust was held up mostly because business thus far anyway. But since Russia showed it's true face, we rather join Nato with all the good and bad that comes with then risk standing alone when Russia decides that actually Finland is part of ol' Russia or whatever. We have history, you know."
571,"Nuclear energy is clean? Alternative energy will never solve our problems but it makes us feel good? Both those statements can only be valid when a monetization model is in place. If energy production and distribution was forced into a ""free"" and public usage model, population growth was limited to include consumption the second statement almost assuredly becomes valid."
572,Why no mention of thorium salt reactors.   A nuclear source with a much safer prospect for humanity.
573,"‚ÄúHe‚Äòs done a good enough job that the Russian people kept him there.‚Äú
Is he serious? So Lukashenko also seems to do a good enough job, because the Belarussian people ‚Äúkept him there‚Äù?"
574,Henry Kisinger. He said the trouth. Biden has to listen to Kisinger. He's a storagestic political brain. Evev I don't like his but he said the truth
575,"It is important to realise that this is Mr. Stone's perspective on the situation, and not necessarily absolute truth with regards the situation in Ukraine."
576,"An Explanation of Why Things Are as They Are

Are you tired of it's about good vs. evil? Let's unpack that once and for all. History has had these same two threads running through it forever, it seems. I would like to suggest that every individual has a similar two threads running as well, that ""the outside is a reflection of the inside"". The heart vs. the brain or ego. Let's say that the brain or the ego construct wants to receive, wants to build the tower of babel to the sky, a monument to the ego. And the heart only wants to give, to care. The ego can be rapacious, can kill, can hurt, can lack empathy, it is the animal part of us, ""might makes right"". The heart on the other hand is non violent, will only be violent to protect. It is the feminine, it is only about love and caring. ""The line between good and evil runs through the heart of every man."" Alexander Solzhenitsyn.

So, therein lies the problem.This ""civil war"" within each of us and the war and domination outside. Why does it seem that it is the ""might makes right"" side that has dominated history all the way back? The side that uses bribes, blackmail, propaganda, intimidation, and murder to maintain its dominance https://cynthiachung.substack.com/p/sleepwalking-into-fascism-why-cianatos?s=r. Is it simply because the abusive side has no compunction when it comes to taking the lives of others, while the caring side will only commit violence to protect against violence?

The constant programming and propaganda promotes capitalism, egotism, egoism, individualism, materialism, consumerism, and war, so that the spiritual side, the heart side, is marginalized and is the rarity. Such that we think of those who have demonstrated heartfulness, love, and caring as saints and heroes; ie. MLK, Mother Teresa, Gandhi, etc. Those who demonstrate unconditional love for all are the gurus and sages, the ""illuminated"" ones. Yet it is within all of us, hidden and dormant. We can love the purity that everyone has or is, while at the same time abhorring the cruelties that others perpetuate. It is not impossible at all to reach this state, to fully open one's heart, to just be love.

Because of the dominance of the ego, we have permitted and allowed the daily atrocities for centuries and now the inevitable consequences are upon us. People have been programmed to identify with their ego. But while the ego serves a purpose and is necessary, it is not who we really are. We are the ego, but we are also a part of the tree of life, and our branch is humanity.

This part has been expunged from our psyches and ignored and forgotten. If everyone could better understand who we really are, that is, individuated and a part of the whole at the same time, the world would be the paradise that it is and always has been, and all that we have done to efface this with the contamination and cement would disappear.

It is the invisible that supports everything, the fundament. And it is the spirit that underlies everything within. The identification with the ego at the expense of the spirit is an inaccurate and superficial understanding and is perhaps the cause of all the bad decisions that has brought humanity to the impasse that it faces today with the risk of nuclear war, the climate crises, and the rise of totalitarianism.

Just for absolute clarity, imagine a leaf with consciousness thinking that it is only a leaf, and not recognizing that it is a part of a tree. That is humanity when only identifying with the ego.

If people could only stop judging themselves and others, to separate the action from the person, one could have unconditional love for all, which I believe is the necessary ground for creating the more beautiful world we all long for."
577,"I really wanted to watch this podcast to get the other side‚Äôs view on the Ukraine situation but I gotta say, if this is the best that side has, that‚Äôs a real shame. Love stone‚Äôs movies but he is completely, utterly full of shit. To hear him talk about the US‚Äôs disrespect for sovereignty of countries like China, Cuba, Iran, etc.; and then a few minutes later justify a full scale invasion resulting in 10‚Äôs if not 100‚Äôs of thousands of deaths, and millions of refugees. Honestly just pissing me off."
578,"With regards to Elon Musk speaking freely. What was he really doing in Brazil with the far right president of Brazil last week? And what about his threat on the Bolivian ( lithium ) election a few years ago?  In response to a tweet that accused the U.S. government of forcing Morales out, allowing Musk to access Bolivian resources, he wrote: ‚ÄúWe will coup whoever we want! Deal with it."""
579,"You are perhaps the first one to truly expose how shallow and biased Oliver really is. Good work Lex! I wish you'd followed up with more questions when he forms a conclusion while admitting that he only considered one side.
Many tried but you'd tickled it we'll."
580,"""do countries go to war over energy?"" Oliver Stoner....""ummm i dont know...id have to make a documentary about it"" .....this guys menna be an intellect?"
581,"Very interesting the point of ""dealing diplomatically with USA"", as they will never commit to any deal, and they will break unilaterally as soon as it is covenient for them..., basically that policy is inherited from the UK, which only respects treaties and UN resolutions that are convenient for them but the will simply ignore or bypass those not good (enough) for them. Latest case, unilateral position by the US about Western Sahara, notwithstanding many UN resolutions as in other cases of decolonisation.."

""Whom the gods would destroy they first make mad"""
585,"I've watched this conversation, with intense concentration 3 times. To learn, to open my mind, expand my current understanding of these subjects...my realization is that this man, Oliver Stone seems anti-America, anti-democracy. His ""seeking to understand"" seems one sided...This man is very intelligent & well spoken, but completely unempathetic to the actual human suffering involved with the fights for freedom & equality. Maybe I'll watch 1 more time.."
586,Countries going to war over anything? Fascinating question.
587,What is scary for me is the erosion of top soil and the low quality food as a result.
588,"What an utterly FANTASTIC interview. I will be watching this channel FAR more often, as well as more Stone films.  The Anti-Russians in power in Ukraine (and the Coup in 2013) are atrocious acts of aggression by the US that the US would NEVER tolerate. I'm ashamed of my country, and wish I could do something that mitigated our harm. 

Calculating the doubling-rate of anything requires only to divide 70 by the rate (2% per month would double every 35 months). Global population increases at 3.5% per annum, thus, doubles every 20y. Average CO2 consumption per person also increases 3.5% per annum & an aggregate of 7% ‚Äì‚Äì doubling every 10 years (if stats are static & accurate, obviously)."
589,"what a sham, he talks about sovereignty in the same breath talking about Putin, did not think Stone is so deranged

But I think Stone was lured in by the strategic KGB charm that Putin is able to convey - and i can see that this has worked on many people - in fact watching some of Putin's interviews, i could be a victim myself. Now though, it should be time to wake up, even for Stone"
590,"I also asked myself the same question, what if Russia surrendered Donbass and receive all the refugees.  But would US stop then?   It is just a matter of time.  Perhaps Russia think they are ready."
591,"I'm Australian from English parents. I think Putin did the right and only way 100%. I feel Lex more on the Ukrainian side. Two countries I really discussed with is 1. UK, my father's brother lost his life at 18 fighting Germans never experienced love or having a family. My mother's brother lost his mind fighting Germans, he 2 never experienced love or having a family and my mother's father was enlisted in his late 40s to go and fight Germans.  2. Germany, German people turned a blind eye in the 30's on Nazis, I believe they shouldn't have the hide, to turn a blind eye on Nazis again."
592,Japan was at war for many years to obtain Oil.  Energy and resourses to supply their military might.   Pearl Harbor was bombed because USA withheld oil and resources to Japan.
593,"If Oliver stone could make the rest of the doors look like sellouts to make Vladimir Putin look good, he would do it."
594,"Hey Lex, I am a fan and I probably listened to 95% of your podcasts. It is nice that you look to offer a different perspective, but I think that it would be even better if this interview would have been more connected with reality and facts. Several times sounded like Ukraine is really to blame and Russia is just a victim, when in reality Ukrainian cities get destroyed and civilians are dying. Some push back based on facts would be really useful otherwise every think sounds like a big conspiracy theory and that does not make for a healthy conversation."
595,Lex keeps delivering. Propz man.

607,"Yea, Russia want Putin and has a proper perspective to do that. While on a 2005 train ride from Moscow to Kyiv a conversation with drunk Russian fellow finished with Putin can be President as long as he wants, King Putin. ... In 2014 a Yaroslavl friend posted on FB an article about the Russia Duma voting to allow military use in Ukraine. I commented concerning having just been in Odessa and meeting people from Donetsk on the street with 'not much' having just arrived. A doctor told me she received a phone call in the morning telling her to leave 'NOW'. So she did. Lost her phone to a pickpocket while at the station. She attributed the situation to business interests, mining or heavy industry, realizing they could make a deal with Putin for the creation of their own fief free from Ukraine's government. ... My Yaroslavl friend commented, ""we don't hear that here"" and then deleted her post."

AusKor dude"
610,brilliant insight 53:20
611,"I'm a big fan of Oliver Stone... you may not agree with every perspective he has on everything, but I love the idea of having a critical mind and understanding that there exists propaganda from both sides of conflict.  Certainly I'm not siding with Putin, who is clearly an evil man, but I think it is healthy to understand all the facts and question how the West might be influencing our opinions.  Particular great example when he discusses NATO and how these European countries joining NATO lose a bit of sovereignty, with US putting military bases and nuclear weapons on their land.  He is right, they are basically tied to what the US wants in conflicts.  I don't agree however that Putin went to war because the US told their allies he would.  The US started warning its allies when Russia put hundreds of thousands of troops on the border, which was cause for alarm.  Putin didn't have to do that, and ultimately he didn't have to invade, it was a choice.  Putin's biggest mistake is under-estimating how costly and inefficient it will be to occupy the Ukraine after it invades.  If you destroy all the infrastructure, how are you capitalizing on the invasion?  It would take years to organize and take advantage of the natural resources, and by then, the West has completely isolated Russia."
612,this was a plesure!
613,"Oliver Stone, ever the high priest of Whataboutism :D"
614,Wow he sure said some hard truths most Americans don‚Äôt like to think about
615,Oliver Stone has lived such an interesting life. Cool interview Lex
616,Comrade Stone is the real Merican hero just like Comrade Seagal speak the truth mother Russia will remember.
617,"Mr. Stone always tried to understand other sides of the official storytelling. He did it with USA and sometimes did well. But now,  saying Putin is not a dictator and he is there because is loved by Russians, demonstrates he does not know that many countries never had a democracy. He applies western mindset to different cultures. Most countries do not decide, they accept the power because they are scared, they are passive and they accept what is in power."
618,1:05:18 Colombian paramilitaries are nothing compared to the Venezuelan collectivos. Ask anyone whose been there. The fact that he plays this misleading shell game discredits everything he says.
619,"I don't think Stone should say he tries not to be ""too over factual"".  That is not what the public needs if we want to solve problems. But I think his goal maybe is not to be factual but to defend Russia.   And sovereignty has been violated.  Stone has seemed not to take into account that Russia violated what he said was important:  sovereignty of Ukraine.   I do not agree with Stone on what I have seen with my own eyes.  I don't think he ""sees"" and nobody accuses me of that--the opposite."
620,Andrew Breitbart died from asking the wrong questions
621,Min 1:22 i also think it was calculated: he has created very strong ties with China and some other countries over the years planning for alternative markets. The man is a strategist and very smart at that. Russia is doing fine still while the West is dealing with lots of fallout in their economy. I don‚Äôt like this because i live in the West. But i see him as having a long game and the West having no game.
622,"I watched this for Oliver and came away incredibly impressed with Lex Fridman, a very impressive young man."

625,"CO2 is not a problem.  More CO2 means more photosynthesis, more plant growth, and by extension more animal growth.  NASA global surveys have proven that earth is greener today than in the 1970s.  More CO2 means a greener earth.  Nuclear is ok too, but we should not shy away from clean CO2."
626,Why did Stone believe what Putin was saying all those years ago?
627,"""Nuclear power is a hell of a way to boil water..."" Einstein"
628,"The interviewer doesn't seem very informed or is naive and wishful thinking. He keeps saying putin made a mistake or putin is sick as if those are the only options.  From the information i know, putin is winning."
629,For many commentators in this section it must be unbearable to listen to a different well educated and opinionated voice as it shatters everything they believed and believe up to this point.
630,GOD BLESS PUTIN
631,"I feel like Oliver has a lot of good points to make, but he rambles too much and doesn't structure his arguments in a succinct, presentable way"
632,Never thought that Mr. Stone is using his right to vote and that he thought Trump is more dangerous than Biden. That's a paradox.
633,"For someone known for extensive, detailed research on the subject matter he covers, Oliver's understanding of energy policy in general, and nuclear in particular, comes up short.

Criticism of renewables like solar and wind is valid, but nuclear suffers from the same basic problem, and that is: all alternative energy sources (including nuclear) run primarily on fossil fuels.

Mining, transportation, and processing of uranium is very dirty. In addition, the massive input of materials needed to build nuclear plants means that they take a very long time to 'burn off' their carbon debt. Complexity is costly.

In the short run, solar and wind beat nuclear cost-wise because they can be brought online almost instantly. But, in order to ramp them up to displace current energy generation would require most of the known reserves of precious and semi-precious metals on Earth.

Ramping up nuclear to displace current sources would run into some of the same issues, and uranium is itself non-renewable .

The only real solution at present (projecting out from current conditions) is a radical restructuring of all human systems: energy, transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, etc., to make the most of our dwindling reserves of fossil fuels to get us through the transition (google 'degrowth').

Efficiency (i.e. reduction of wasteful energy usage) is the key--it is the mother of all carbon reduction plans."
634,"Hello. I would like to congratulate Mr. Lex Fridman for this interview with Mr. Oliver Stone. But I have a reproach to make to you if you allow me. Like many others, you do not seem to distinguish sufficiently between the notion of an individual and that of a function, in this case a state function. You psychologize and do not distinguish state logic well. Individuals are one thing states another absolutely distinct. We could say so much if we were talking about economic enterprises."
635,"Sad what happen to JFK, Vietnam and all these major conflicts we thrown money into would‚Äôve never happen."
636,"Oliver Stone is very open minded, thanks god he exists."
637,"God wrote Ephraim and Manasseh would expand out and exactly as was written has happeend because God ordained it.  look it up.  Raymond E Capt does an incredible job covering this in ""Joseph's Birthright, Judah's Scepter"". eye opening, logical and incredible insight into the trutv Hod wanted us to know and see in the World- all reinforces strong faith to stand against lies."
638,"Finally, intelligent, not simplistic talk."
639,"Jeez, Oliver.. you don't think the prospect of spending 15 years in jail if you criticize the Special Operation isn't a factor in maintaining support for Putin?"
640,World War II was largely about energy resource access.
641,"I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of America, but listening to Stone makes me want to defend the country I was born in.."
642,"Patrick Moore has been telling governments, around the world, this for decades and a lot didn't listen. Now others are getting the attention off of his research and claiming praise, It's called ""thriving off of other people's  talents"" There are millions at it everyday ..."
643,"23:00 Thinks Poland invaded Russia in WW2? Was that the same Poland that had been entirely removed from the map by the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact? ""Always attacking Russia"" those pesky Poles. NaPOLEon Bonaparte, do you see, do you?
28:30 ""Sovereignty for countries is crucial - sovereignty for China; sovereignty for Russia; sovereignty for Iran; sovereignty for Venezuela"" - think you may be missing one Oli - clue: it starts with a U and you're not welcome there. 
I had to stop there, but I'm sure there were plenty more 'gems' of that ilk.
Anyway, well done Rex for deftly avoiding asking any difficult questions or challenging his uninformed fictitious takes on pseudo-history/geopolitics. Very much in the spirit of Stone's own Putin interviews. Good Job mate.

645,Never been a huge fan of Oliver Stone but I really appreciate his sense of nuance and honesty. Great interview!
646,Putin has played stone a right good one & stone fell for it all HOOK LINE & SINKER.
647,"If you don't know why Putin invaded Ukraine, you need to check out some Peter Zeihan videos on the subject - right here on Youtube."
648,"British engineers developed Donbas coal and iron for the Tsar, for Russia. Obviously, this war will end with a treaty declaring Crimea and Donbas to be Russian. Sign the treaty now. Why wait until 2023 or 2025?"
649,I really like Oliver Stone‚Ä¶ brilliant man. I‚Äôve never listened to him before. I also like Elon Musk for his stance on free speech and the willingness to speak freely. You both are refreshing to listen to. Many blessings to you all. We need more of these kind of talks. I also agree that Putin is a man of wisdom. MSM gives him a bad rap.

652,Hmm i wonder if it is just the incompetency of his generals and the russian state TV that paint him in such a bad light.
653,"¬´I found him to be calm¬ª - yeah, like a Cold blooded murderer."
654,Oliver Stone sounds like a cheerleader for Putin.  Honestly I didn't even finish the interview I was so disgusted.  No way is Putin a great guy like Stone wants us to believe.  How can anyone say this today???
655,Oliver what about the future of thorium reactors? Byproducts appear to be less problematic than nuclear? My understanding is functional thorium reactors had been developed decades ago in the U.S. but were set aside due to lack of military application.
656,It's kind of insulting how he removes agency from European countries regarding their support of Ukraine. I agree with Stone on a lot of things so it's frustrating to see him struggle with the cognitive dissonance over the fact that Ukraine and their western allies are the good guys in this situation. He's clearly been exposed to a lot of the Russian propaganda over Ukraine.
657,"1:30 to 1:35 very important. Whole thing worth the watch, but this segment nails the crisis we face."
658,concepts here few realize they carry with them everyday and perhaps achieve clarity when they draw their last breath.
659,"Putin is very proud of keeping his country strong and unified, even when it wasn't.  His vision for his country is a positive one, not a hostile rival of others.  Until he got to know the way the united states was being run and their antagonistic view of any other countries success, he didn't realize what he was up against.  Many of us still don't understand the animosity of the USA towards certain other powerful countries. Why can't we all just treat each other with mutual respect and get along? There's enough problems in the world concerning climate change and our survival as humans; we don't need to worry about fictitious problems created out of egos and greed"
660,Lex never stop
661,Really enjoyed this interview. Great questions and Oliver Stone has an honesty which is a rare commodity these days.
662,"I appreciated Lex's patient approach.  This was illuminating.  I've respected Oliver Stone's work, but concerned he is now more willing to defy Occam's Razor, and try and pin the use of chemical weapons other than Russia, discounts the possibility that Putin has been corrupted by power within Russia, ignore the awards Putin flagrantly gave to the poisoners of Salisbury, even impute a false flag nuclear explosion might happen at the behest of the US, and lastly to only take counsel from pro-nuclear power experts (he didn't mention any contrary opinions being included in his upcoming documentary).  He is a great director, but something has happened. It's almost like the weight of evidence doesn't matter."
663,Excellent interview. I really admire Oliver Stone for expressing his true feelings. This is one of the best open minded interviews I ever listened.
664,"Yikes!  Oliver Stone, is an OLD man.  He rambles on and on distorting his how facts.  I enjoy his movies because they are entertaining, but he is in Putin's pocket...and getting played.  Shame."
665,Wow. What a great insight.
666,"Utilizing fast breeder reactors there is the equivalent 3x energy content in the ""spent"" nuclear fuel in the world than the energy content contained in the worlds oil reserves....... Just in the ""waste"""
667,"4:38

Per Capita the US actually is #10 in energy consumption and it's not even close. Per kilowatt hours the US spends less than half of what the top 3 spend."
668,"Censorship of opposing ideas is about controlling popular opinion, so as to control the way the weak and impressionable people will lean. Allowing opposing ideas to be discussed is about finding what is reasonable."
669,outstanding... I would rate Stone in the same breath as Hemingway... Both have a similar understanding of human frailty...
670,"Horrible interview, simply mocking the memory of the Ukrainians who died in the last 3 months..."
671,"Oliver Stone sounded very reasonable until he started talking about how peace and harmony was always Putin's idea, and ""if the Russian people didn't want him he would be out"""
672,"Iam not comparing Hitler to putin"" but then he references them both in the same sentence about styles of speech"
673,Lex should try to get Werner Herzog on this program.
674,"i am listening to stone, I am not saying the USA is an angel because it is responsible for uncountable innocent deaths but Putin is also the same and his war in Ukraine is totally unacceptable in a society that is purported to be civilized. Also Euro was shocked and disgusted by Putin's invasion because Euro has tasted war on its land before unlike the USA. so that Stone is surprised by this is highly unusual."
675,"""What is the meaning of life?"" is not an absurd question at all."
676,"Lex, great work.

Personal opinion (ignore of not interested in opinions): Despite being a very experienced,, talented man and a esquipedalianist... Oliver Stone reminds me of the older cooks I would cross paths with when smoking pot as a teen. We'd sit around them and listen because they were older and wouldn't stop talking. But, they would say things that would make us peak around at each other thinking ""Did he say that?"""
677,A lone voice of truth in the world of propaganda.
678,Swedish Viking here. Love Oliver Stone. Great brain. I want world peace. Other people are stupid and running around like a sheep.
679,"I always loved this man Oliver Stone, much respect to him and god bless him ‚úå‚úå
'I wouldn't get in (Ukraine), except through Donbas, I'd come' .... That says a lot."
680,Good stuff
681,"How easy life would be, to live blissfully unaware of the intricacies of reality, and perpetuate a simple tribalistic mentality.
To consider all possibilities is hard work."
682,"Lex is amazing as always, but Oliver Stone is either dishonest or delusional about the things he said on this podcast. The former is far more likely; it's disheartening to see a great film maker become such a moral disgrace. The fact he is still willing to launder Vladimir Putin's reputation in 2022 is utterly revulsive."
683,I wish Lex would push back harder against bat shit crazy.
684,"0:27 ""shining a light on the dog parks  of American and global history"""
685,"Why did you put him in your podcast, he is very Americocentrist. He claimed the Ukrainians revolution is a CIA plot etc. he's a clown. He passivly supports Russian imperialism. Greetings from Belgium"
686,Does Mr Stone know for sure what happened in Bucha?
687,"Watch Frontline PBS on youtube. They have done many, many episodes on Russia and Putin over the last thirty years. They have not come to the same conclusion about Putin as Oliver has."
688,props to lex for bringing on someone with an informed and uncompromized take on russia-ukraine
689,Oliver sounds like a spin doctor for Vald
690,Thank you very much
691,"1. ""Medvedev"" is the Russian ex-president, the Ukrainian politician is Medvedchuk. Long-time on Putin's payroll, even had Putin baptize his kid (look it up).
2. ""After 2014 Ukraine stopped being neutral"" Maybe having Crimea occupied by Russia and Donbass captured by Russian-backed proxies had something to do with that. Not sure.

I'm sorry, ""this"" is the guy we're calling informed?"
692,Thanks. for this interview. A lot of people in Europe are sick of the US stupid propaganda.
693,His admiration for Putin unfortunately clouds what would be some very valid points.  He literally defended everything Putin and nearly made him out to be a Saint.  The truth is usually somewhere in the middle but Stone is just as bad as the Neo Cons on the other side.
694,Oliver Stone needs to be updated on Ukraine or he‚Äôs getting his information from the main stream news
695,Fascinating discussion.  So good to hear a person allowed to fully answer questions. I‚Äôm a fan as well. Thank you gentlemen.
696,"Not unless we start making molten salt reactors, as uranium is not something we have in abundance, however we have a huge abundance of thorium."
697,"Oliver Stone OBVIOUSLY has studied his history from ALL perspectives. What he missed is, HE may have empathy towards these politicians. But they don't have it towards him. Oliver is an older, wiser & enlightened individual. He is now gullible more than ever. I find it admirable in his latest films/documentaries. He's speaking up about USA (that has become more imperial than against it)."
698,Boris Johnson is Idiot  (1.19:24 ) this guy make me laugh Ha ha..ü§£ü§£ü§£
699,"Stone lost me when he said ""The poisonings were never proven"". Makes the rest unbelievable"
700,A lot more than 50 people died from Chernobyl Mr. Stone
701,I think if he ever interviews David Lynch the world will explode.
702,"What is the point of having conversations with brilliant people if you take nothing from it Lex? Your appearance on Rogan and what you said about Putin & Russia was shocking, it's like you never talked to Oliver Stone, still same old propaganda and American exceptionalism"
703,A conversation between two of the most important human beings alive today. Thank you gentlemen.
704,"Stone , likes to talk, particularly about shit he seems to have no grasp of."
705,"Thanks for this interview. I think that Mr. Stone believes that all people have their own interests in everything. But how about truth? That's very important to distinguish what's ""white"" and what's ""black"" - Mr. Stone have failed in that."
706,I‚Äôm surprised that Oliver Stone has not done a movie or documentary about 911?
707,"I really want to respect Mr. Stone‚Äôs position here, but I‚Äôm finding it difficult to given his lack of openness to understand the Ukrainian position. He freely admits to not being to Ukraine since 1983, but has such conviction that Russia carries no blame in the attitude Ukrainians have towards Russians. To me, it‚Äôs a contrast of his typical stance of studying history and in his words ‚Äúseeking the truth‚Äù.

No doubt US has a role in instigating the war, but IMO he‚Äôs not considering how Russia pushed Ukrainians away from them.

Last point, what really separates me from his point of view was his characterization that Ukraine might ‚ÄúInvade the Donbas‚Äù. It wouldn‚Äôt be an invasion to rid your sovereign territory of foreign fighters."
708,"Wind, solar, nuclear are the way forward.  The latter critically important, but it takes too long to build and online the plants for the demand that will be required in the next 10-20 years.
Demonising oil and fossil fuels, is wrong.  We need a transitional period to move to renewables and cleaner energy, but oil is not the demon its made out to be.  Modern cars burn very cleanly and efficiently.  Diesel has been targetted as the evil, but it is something like 8% more efficient than petrol, and cost less to produce as less refinement required.  It produces less CO2 than petrol, fact.  but a little more NOX.
And here is another thing, ask the average green punter how much CO2 makes up air gases, overwhelmingly most of them are completely wrong.  Way off, they're usually into full percentages and even way into double digit percentage, oh dear!
With approx 0.034% of air being C02 as a trace gas, with just 3% of that 0.034% being man made C02, the pure focus on C02 is completely wrong.
Yes the climate is changing, it always has.  But the single biggest contributor to climate control and change is the Sun, that's just fact, physics and actual science, like it or not.
Bet YT censors this and I get zero likes or replies.  Toliet platform."
709,"OK....Chernobyl was not the worst nuclear disaster... Fukushima was and still is.   The nuclear power plants are only built to last about 50 years so expect some more disasters.   There are better energy technologies available that have been supressed by the oil industry.  So much as I admire Mr Stone, I will have to disagree with him on this subject."
710,"He prepared for it, meticulously how is the rouble doing now,best ever,he has china and India and the Africa's seems like the miscalculations have been by the west"
711,"politics and power is a fishy pool of propaganda, Oliver sees that, but he only seems to see it from the side he most understands."
712,what about the even bigger  wall of propagonda in Russia ?
713,"Watching this episode made me some discomfort (Which I appreciate a lot)
 
I agreed with Oliver Stone on
-  how the US is pushing its influence across the globe, 
- Russia has strong oppositions within itself (but we know VERY well its a more dangerous climate to be an opposition there than in the US)
- the lack of empathy of American media and public to anyone who has not subscribed to its political or economic influence, 

BUT 
him speaking of Europe as lacking sovereignty?, 
whitewashing Russia's invasion of Ukraine and its atrocities in the war (as he mentions from 2014)
praising the work of Russia's RT? 
And with all that, assuming Putin can be removed from power by Public pressure ... 
 
There is a funny irony here, his standards of assessing foreign policies for Russia and US & the West are different. 
It is funny because American media does the same thing;
Mr Stone; tough on US, soft on Russia,
US Media; tough on Russia, soft on US"
714,God Blesses Oliver.
715,"‚ÄúUSA bad, Russia good‚Äù got it"
716,The Truth has been Spoken. Thank you Mr. Stone.
717,"Yes, yes‚Ä¶ poor PutinüôÑ I especially loved the part where Pooptin is a strong advocate of sovereign statesü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"
718,"Electricity from nuclear power is too expensive. Wind and solar are cheaper, and the gap is going to get bigger, not smaller. I don't get why people keep talking about nuclear. You need something that can be a fallback for when you don't have enough wind and sun that can be turned on quickly. That is not nuclear."
719,Oliver Stone is the goat
720,This is a great advertisement for nuclear energy
721,Keep in mind he‚Äôs a storyteller not a historian.  The JFK movie was entertaining but largely total fiction.  I‚Äôll watch his movies but I‚Äôm not taking any stock in his geopolitical viewpoint.
722,"Just watched two of his films about Ukraine. The story is really one-sided, I mean there's only Putun and prorussian Ukrainian politicians. I thought,  that if you are trying to find the truth you need to show the story from as many sides as possible. The whole story  looks like Russian propaganda. Maybe because of that those films were shown on Russian TV."
723,"What an excellent podcast! Thank you for providing this. 

Oliver Stone is a voice very well needed in a time like this. It is so refreshing to hear a more accurate portrayal of the situation in Ukraine."
724,I thought Rod Serling was deceased!
725,He's so used to creating fiction he can't tell the difference between real and not real.
726,"Oliver Stone has made some great films. 

But Oliver Stone is wrong about Nuclear energy. I am so disappointed in him. It takes no brains to realize that an energy source that produces pollution that last thousands of  years is a dumb idea!"
727,"I'm looking for some education here. In Stone's March 3rd post he refers to the build up of ukrainian troops in the donbass and the necessity to save russian speakers there. When exactly did this build up start? If it was after the annexation of Crimea, then it's hard to see how Ukraine had any other choice but to have active military presence in the donbass? appreciate your input"
728,Oliver Stone should do a documentation about Young Global Leaders
729,"He‚Äôs very thoughtful and he‚Äôs right about a ton of this stuff , but he just can‚Äôt shake his knee jerk hatred of the old right. Even in this conversation (as America is completely controlled by the radical  Democrat Left) he still uses terms, blaming the present war on the
 neo-conservative."
730,I wonder if Oliver Stone would like to have a nuclear power station in his backyard. When he lets them build one there I will reconsider my stance on the issue.

My country, Slovakia is under the üá™üá∫ & üá∫üá∏ influence and we pay huge price for it- censorship, alternative media shut down, inflation, cultural deterioration.... You name it."
733,lex gona be the podcast king one day üôå
734,Impressive interview. Great work.
735,"""Ukrainian aggression"". Classic victim blaming"
736,It‚Äôs incredible to me what Oliver Stone either has become or always was.  Incredibly hard to listen to. He has turned into a caricature of himself.
737,OUTSTANDING JOB BY O.liver Stone!!  Right ON!
738,A voice and shining light of reason in these times - how refreshing!
739,"It‚Äôs too bad he gets so many details wrong. The wide strokes are backed by history, but it doesn‚Äôt seem to be his own thinking."
740,Well he lost my interest when he said up until now we haven‚Äôt had conflict over energy.  Any idiot knows that simply isn‚Äôt true.
741,"The world wants peace.  The people of the world want peace.  Big countries being aggressive will press the peace loving people ever closer. This is how it is now, the information age enables it."
742,"This is by far the hardest interview to listen. It feels like Oliver Stone wants to justify every horrific desicion made by Putin, and it is only United States fault that russians invaded Ukraine. I am from Eastern Europe and Eastern Europe countries much more prefer to collaborate with western countries, than go back to Soviet Union, which I think Putin wants to rebuild. I get shivers when thinking how horrible it would be to go back to these dark oppresed times."
743,This guy is awesome.  Nails it on most points.
744,"Ukraine on fire, U need to watch"
745,"18:06 - This is exactly how Russia views America, you turn on the TV and basically they tell you that if there is shit in your house, well it's probably the Americans who shat in your house!"
746,Why hasn‚Äôt anybody in the West talk about hydrogen as energy source?
747,"I respect everything that is said in this VIDEO and i keep an open mind on both sides ... but still, only the fact that MR. STONE can speak freely about the ""bad"" ideeas and initiatives that the USA have tells a lot about what would happen if there was a ""russian"" version of MR. STONE where he spoke freely against the Russian GOV, i think well .. he would have  been ""popped"" . P.S. Historically speaking nothing good came towards the small eastern countries of Europe from Russia, my grandmother told me stories of how she always went to hide in the CORN fields when Russian Soldiers came thru our small town, just to not get rapped, what i'm telling you is TRUE ...."
748,A good reporter has skepticism when conducting an interview. Stone seems to have bought into everything Putin told him without any degree of skepticism. But if Russia is so much more moral than the US maybe Stone should live there?
749,Thank you Lex and Oliver very much.... for a very decent and informative interview. We need to know this truth.
750,"hearing Oliver Stone admire Putin's idea of ""sovereignty"" of Russia... What about Ukraine's sovereignty !?"
751,"Has anyone watched ""Three Mile Island"" on Netflix? While people didn't die, the aftermath is still real. The cancer rates are real. So suffering for years and watching family members die from cancer isn't real? I still question nuclear."
752,He sounds so pro russian
753,"The direct deaths of nuclear accidents are low, but Oliver Stone ignored the number who got sick, displaced and who died later on. Still I do agree that nuclear has an important role to play, it's just that we need to be smart about how and where nuclear power plants are used."
754,"One thing is to see someone talking bullshit and denying basic facts during an interview, another thing is to have the interviewer like Lex Fridman nodding to that and not asking any tricky questions... 

Saying that Chornobyl tragedy only had 50 victims... It's total disrespect to thousands who sacrificed their lives to liquidate the consequences of the explosion (died soon after). Not even mentioning millions of people whose health was affected in long term, with increased risk of cancer, etc due to the impact of particles. It continues even now. Of course, easy to say that when you were lucky to be on the other side of the planet at the moment."
755,"50 people died at Chernobyl is the official number, a person who's full time job is to be sceptical about the government somehow believe the official number here !!!!! How ironic üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
756,"The beggining of the end for Napoleon, considered one of histories greatest military strategist, started when he tried to invade Russia just like Hitler a couple of decades later. Napoleon's own account was: ""The most terrible of all my battles was the one before Moscow. The French showed themselves to be worthy of victory, but the Russians showed themselves worthy of being invincible."""
757,"I'm just a 66 year old peasant from the sticks who takes an interest in history and human affairs. I've never heard OS before and thought it would be interesting to hear him, as I'm familiar with many of his movies. It soon became very clear where his sympathies lie, but that's fine because I thought those things once when I was young. But when this 76 year old said things like ""Poland keeps attacking Russia"" and then, ""I'm not naive"". Well, my jaw just hit the floor and I began to feel embarrassed for him.
 Like Lex though. He is admirably curious, sounds fair minded and seems to be providing the kind of inquisition you just don't get on main stream.
 And that's all I have to say about that.ü§î"
758,"The desire to understand a person's thoughts and the interview flow is fantastic, thank you @LexFriedman. But the one-sided view on Ukraine is disturbing: ""...last time I was to Ukraine eighties ..."" ""... Ukraine is run by Nationalists..."" even though the nationalistic party didn't even make it to parliament in the last election due to lack of support. ""...Ukraine would eventually attack Russia..."" - then how comes that the country can't resist Russia without weapons supplied by the western partners. These are narratives coming from RT and not supported by independent sources.
Both of you definitely need to come to Ukraine after the war ends - no one will threaten you, even Mr Oliver Stone. Russian journalists from Meduza and similar publishers were in Ukraine during the first months of war and reported a lot - still alive and trying to break through the curtain in Russia. The best way to cut through propaganda these days is to experience yourself. (full disclosure - I'm a Ukraine citizen, lived in US, and visited Russian before the invasion of 2014 multiple times - seen different worlds)"
759,Sensationalism and self indulgent ego motivated posturing!
760,Thank you and bless you::))
761,"Very interesting interview and good with another perspective. It's easy to sit in an echo chamber. However it's clear that Oliver Stone falls into the black and white thinking that he is opposing  himself. His nuance on Russia is great to hear, but equally sad to hear the lack of nuance, compassion or open mind when talking about Ukraine or western countries.
He believes Ukrainians targets people around the world, but does not think Putin is capable of the same? It's a bit of logical fallacy going on there.
Very interesting interview Lex! :)"
762,"Many that see Putin as a victim to NATO expansion don‚Äòt know about the Budapest memorandum of 1994.

What anything else did we know a movie director could do other than tell a group of over-paid people with pretty faces to pretend to have a story in front of a camera, in order to manipulate other people's emotions."

I'd love to hear some real data on those countless murders of Ukrainians by Ukrainian army he talks about, and also proper timeline of Ukrainian troop buildup with what was going on - keeping in mind russian troop buildup started in early 2021."
783,"I grew up in communistic Poland. In the official talks USSR was called big brother. The regular people could not say anything positive about our neighbor, USSR.

784,"I wonder why  the energy industry isn't using Geothermal? The Earth is warm to hot everywhere, not just in volcanic areas, drilling a deep hole outside a coal fired plant could use the turbines and generators instead of building new, using a more  volatile fluid than water in a double tube providing up and down in the same hole and more than one hole to provide greater volume. Some modification would be necessary but it would be so much cheaper for the mega corporations that already own the power plant. Just a thought that hit me hearing them talk about nuclear power."
785,God bless Oliver Stone's honesty and courage in the face of the unrelenting propaganda war waged by the West. But I now understand better why Lex toed the line so hard on Joe Rogan's podcast.

790,"Lex thanks that you enterviewed him, but from your opinions it is like you do not listen to him. Did he specified that Ukraine was shelling Dombas before Russia attacked. I think Putin couldn't see anyway, and he needed to act, as sad as it is."

I started listening and couldnt stop...fascinating interview by a knowledgable pro. The yield is an objective conversation between informed and pragmatic adults. In comparison, current American pop media & S. Colbert are childish, emotional embarrassments. Glad I tuned in."
794,"Good interview, but I sense that the interviewer is trying to get Mr. Stone to say something negative about Putin the whole time.
It's also strange that neither one of them brought up the subject of the more than 30  bioweapons labs in Ukraine.
While any war is a horrible thing for the civilians population, it becomes a necessary solution when the situation threatens the very existence of an entire country with a way larger population like Russia.
It's very hypocritical that many people are very quick to blame Putin for the whole situation but forget the US response during the Cuban Missile Crisis."
795,"No wonder that Vladimir Lenin was calling this type of people ""useful idiots"".  I think if he had had a chance to talk to  Vladimir Bukovskyi, maybe he might be able to see a little better that kind of ""honest man"".

796,"1:24:40 Everyone needs to understand what Mr. Stone says here, especially how he responds to Lex's obvious Neoconartist/Neodemonic ""social justice"" conditioning he's been dead frightened of lately in his emails and his published criticism."
797,WOW!!!  Oliver has the best and clear explanation of what‚Äôs really going on.
798,"I always had a big respect to Oliver, but this one sided story he were telling just sucked off the whole respect thing out of it.

799,"There are, were, bad actors in all societies. The worry is that if a US or ANY other Western politician behaves badly, there is an assumption all are suspect. Views of Chomsky, another whom I otherwise admire - again with similar reservations. 
In Western societies, these are called out - imagine Oliver doing this against Russia, (China, Iran etc.) He would need to be a lot luckier based there, than here! 

TFG, like Oliver, also admired and trusted Putin, including private talks with NO American present. 
Putin spent a life dissembling - in my view effectively, Oliver, with having US suspicion baked in.
Many who did what Oliver does safely in the West are now dead or in prison.
 
Anybody who can pretend the apparent facts in Ukraine are somehow inventive must place serious doubt on their views. The thousands of Russians massed are accepted.

Crucially, that the West/Ukraine deliberately invading Russia, or Russian separatists could ONLY be calamitous for all. As we are all experiencing - and the poor in 3rd world worse than all.
It would clearly be madness from everyone's point of view. 

Just ignored. Sorry Oliver. Blinded now by anti-western bias. Also ignored the thousands of Russians suffering/leaving, against Putin. 
ALL Western stooges? Really?"

802,"I used to be a passively brainwashed so called liberal with blame not of my own but the American media including Colbert's, until I met a Russian friend, a low key, wise, kind, intelligent person, who told me if it weren't for Putin, Russia wouldn't be what t is today (would be in a misery that used to be there), and that's why we love him so much. That's a turnaround point for me. With THAT and all the new found history and information hidden, distorted by the MSM, I was able to come out of the ages old propaganda I was born immersed in. Now i look at all the people manipulated by the empire's rhetoric control machine with empathy and pray that they wake up to reality as soon as possible."
803,"Lex, I love your podcast, and the Western narrative should definitely be questioned, but Oliver is spouting pure lies and propaganda. If you are going to give someone like him a platform, I would strongly suggest you be prepared to question him and challenge him when he makes false claims."
804,"Stone looks way diffrent than other videos. Seems confused, should watch Vice 2014 piece on Ukraine."
805,"We cannot analyze the Russian invasion of Ukraine
without taking the Donbas conflict, which has been

ongoing since 2014, into account.‚Äù

Ukrainian forces had built up on the border, and Stone believes Ukraine was actually

planning to invade Donbas. Russia then responded by sending forces to the border, but

this buildup on both sides has been largely ignored by Western media, which portrayed it

as a sudden and unprovoked invasion by Russia.

In other words, we cannot analyze the Russian invasion of Ukraine without taking the

Donbas conflict, which has been ongoing since 2014, into account. Stone is convinced

that Poroshenko was instructed, from the start of his presidency, to refuse negotiations

with Russia, and to maintain a hostile stance.

‚ÄúThis is very, very dangerous,‚Äù Stone says. Zelensky, also, has maintained this stance

since 2019. ‚ÄúThe whole world is being hurt by this, and no one is calling it out.‚Äù

Stone believes Putin realized that the U.S. is intent on regime change in Russia, and are

willing to destroy Ukraine to do it. So, he took action. Fridman suggests the Ukraine

conflict may in reality be a proxy war between Russia and the U.S., and Stone seems to

agree with this theory. But that still doesn‚Äôt give us any greater insight into this war.

Putin could have surrendered the Donbas and offered safe harbor for the refugees. He

chose not to, but why we don‚Äôt know.

Whatever the reason, Stone is convinced that it was a calculated move ‚Äî and not one

based on the misuse of power. He also points out that Zelensky had mentioned bringing

in nuclear weapons into Ukraine shortly before Russia‚Äôs invasion, which could have set

off alarms and influenced Putin‚Äôs decisions.

Stone also warns that the U.S. is more than capable of a nuclear and/or chemical false

flag. A small nuclear device could be set off in the Donbas, and even if it didn‚Äôt make

sense, the propaganda machine would automatically blame it on Russia. Of course,

Russia also has a significant nuclear arsenal, which could be brought to the fore.

‚ÄúCan we walk back from the brink of nuclear war?‚Äù Fridman asks. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù Stone replies.

‚ÄúWhat do we need to walk it back?‚Äù Stone replies:

‚ÄúReason. Reason, and then diplomacy. Talk to the guy. Mr. Biden, why don‚Äôt you

calm down and go talk to Mr. Putin in Moscow. And try to have a discussion

without falling into ideologiesver Stone, an award-winning film director, was the executive producer of ‚ÄúUkraine on
Fire,‚Äù a documentary that came out in 2016. Stone also interviewed Russian President

Ukraine on Fire

‚ÄúUkraine on Fire‚Äù focused on the Maidan Revolution that began in Kiev in 2013. After

three months of peaceful protests against the Ukrainian government‚Äôs decision to not

sign a comprehensive free trade agreement with the EU, favoring an offer from Russia

instead, deadly violence broke out.

Petro Poroshenko was elected president in a special election in May 2014. According to

the official story, Ukrainians were dissatisfied with president Viktor Yanukovych‚Äôs

‚Äúgrowing authoritarianism,‚Äù and his refusal to sign the EU association agreement, so

they overthrew him.

Yanukovych and other high-level officials, however, claim the violent revolution was

orchestrated by the U.S. for the purpose of regime change. Leaked conversations

revealed top-level officials discussing how to implement a coup to overthrow Ukraine‚Äôs

democratically elected government.

You can read more about this and see the film in my previous article, ‚ÄúUkraine on Fire:

2016 Documentary by Oliver Stone.‚Äù The current president of Ukraine, Volodymyr

Zelensky, a former comedian and actor, was voted in in April 2019.

Putin, the Leader and the Man

In this interview, Fridman and Stone primarily focus on Putin ‚Äî how and what he thinks,

based on Stone‚Äôs perception of the man ‚Äî and Russia‚Äôs incursion into Ukraine. Stone



presents a different side of Putin that many Americans probably have never seen, and

explains why Putin‚Äôs behavior is, perhaps surprisingly, rational.

The U.S. has a long history of anti-Soviet bias. As noted by Stone, the American stance

was that capitalism works and communism doesn‚Äôt. Modern Russia is no longer

communist, yet the U.S. antagonism against Russia remains, while the U.S.

government, ironically, is now doing everything in its power, and beyond, to implement

communism here.

Stone notes that Putin is ‚Äúvery much a market man,‚Äù and has been very clear that he

believes national sovereignty is paramount for world peace and harmonious relations.

Putin insists that all nations must be sovereign, ‚Äúand I believe the United States has

never accepted that,‚Äù Stone says. The U.S., Stone believes, is far more interested in

keeping nations subservient to it and its ideologies.

According to Stone, Putin has a generally good reputation in other countries for being a

man who promotes the interests of his country, but not at the expense of others.

Keeping the world in harmony, ‚Äúthis has always been in his picture,‚Äù Stone insists.

When asked if he thought power had a corrupting influence on Putin, Stone insists that

Putin would never last if he were acting as a dictator. The Russian people would not

keep him in a position of power ‚Äî which he has kept, on and off, for about 20 years.

Russia is a functioning democracy, and the people‚Äôs displeasure would reveal itself in

several different ways. The ballot box is only one avenue by which they exhibit their

dissatisfaction. But, apparently, they think Putin‚Äôs doing a good job at protecting the

country and looking out for its needs.

Fridman, on the other hand, notes he senses a mixture of fear and apathy toward the

leadership when he speaks to Russian family and friends, and this concerns him. Stone

counters Fridman‚Äôs concerns saying he saw ‚Äúfar more freedom in the (Russian) press

than what is pictured in the West, and that means different points of view. Russians are

always arguing among themselves. I‚Äôve never seen a more contentious country.‚Äù


Stone‚Äôs Experience With Putin
Part of Putin‚Äôs political longevity may have something to do with his ability to stay

unruffled. ‚ÄúI never saw him lose his temper,‚Äù Stone says, noting that while most

Americans tend to be emotional, Putin, in contrast, is calm, rational, balanced, mature

and respectful, even under pressure. And, contrary to charismatic dictators such as

former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, Putin doesn‚Äôt try to charm you. He‚Äôs a straightshooter.

All of his interviews with Stone were granted without rules or restrictions. All questions

were allowable. Nothing was off the table. Putin also did not request to see any of the

work before it was published. ‚ÄúHe trusted me,‚Äù Stone says.

According to Stone, Putin has ‚Äúno empire intentions,‚Äù and repeatedly expressed his

desire to have friendly relations with the U.S. Unfortunately, Putin‚Äôs reputation has been

tarnished by U.S. media, people acting from a political agenda, those who never met

him, never went to Russia and don‚Äôt know Russian history. This U.S.-fabricated persona

of Putin as an enemy of both his own people and the rest of the world has made such

relations difficult."
806,"Ukraine are not aliginating you Oliver Stone, they are aliginating themselves."
807,"The nukes are in Scotland, not England. This was a major drive for me to vote for independence!!"
808,Although Mr Stone say he is for freedom of speech I do not think he is really for democracy witch is an interesting contradiction in itself and could explain why he is clearly drawn to dictators ü§î
809,"First time watching Lex. Great questions. Well researched, well prepared, and really interesting. I will watch past shows and subscribe for all shows. Thank you, Lex. I am an American living on the Russian border just 30 km away."
810,Good interview. But Lex Fridman learned nothing about Putin and his mentality and reasoning.
811,"Great interview despite being shocked and saddened to hear his stance on nuclear energy. He's still one of my idols. ( Where we going to put the waste Lex?)
 all your questions were excellent thanks a lot!"
812,"Disagree with a lot of the moronic comments but great interview and it wont stop me from watching his films, just dont agree and think he is totes wrong but good interview"
813,"wow, didn't expect Oliver Stone to be so pro-russian. even now with everything going on when everyone can see it all almost live on youtube. its truly mindblowing."
814,"My word this guy Stone is absolutely in love with Putin,just will not have a bad word said about him.
I'm confused is he an American man or a Russian?"
815,"Lex appears to have arrived unprepared. 01:39:16 ""Churchil was trying to make a deal with him [shitler] in 38"" ?! that is such a blatant lie, even tolerant Lex should have stopped this."
816,"My take, a waste of time listening to a man who has lost all perspective in the mirrored room of his own self admiration!  Apologizing, defending Putin is reckless and indefensible!"
817,"I have enjoyed Oliver Stone's movies and documentaries, but in all his rambling here Putin is blameless, Ukraine's government are thugs, you can't speak out and they're killing journalists (sounds familiar). He criticizes the Western perspective for suppressing 'the other side', but completely supports the Russian perspective and has no criticism for the Russian media. I respect his perspective for challenging the Western narrative, but he seems so wholeheartedly taken in by the Russian narrative it's hard to take him seriously."
818,He's a film maker... Not a philosopher.
819,"Russia‚Äôs Imperial project began in the 17th century ‚Äî ONE HUNDRED YEARS before the US Declaration of Independence ‚Äî not in the 60‚Äôs of the 20th century! The USA being imperialistic or not has got very little to do with the continuity of the imperialist ambitions of Russia.  And, Mr Stone wouldn‚Äôt be surprised by the reaction of people in Europe to the invasion, had he been born and lived in Europe. Apocalypse Now, in my opinion, is the best movie ever made, but O. Stone is very wrong in his views about the backdrop of the current war in Ukraine. O. Stone is basically repeating Kremlin propaganda. 
 Replacing one propaganda with another. Is not enough seeking the truth"
820,"The Only Way to subvert tyranny is to Live so Absolutely Free

822,"""It's not an empire. I see no evidence of it"" Oliver Stone 2022 (after Ukraine is thoroughly destroyed and lost Crimeea in 2014)"
823,You don't support and fund separatists in neighboring countries. Russia is going to feel western anger now
824,I hope this guy lives the rest of his life in Russia
825,"Dear Mr. Stone, Vladimir Putin was a card-carrying member of the communist party for 20 years, in his words ""by choice, not necessity"" and in an interview with Russia and Beyond said that ""he liked and still likes the ideas of communism and socialism"" and compared its ideas to those in the Bible. Obviously, he likes the riches that  his oligarchic rule has provided him, but you would be hard-pressed to explain to Joe McCarthy or anyone else that know his history that Putin was not, at a minimum, an ideological communist."
826,"If l did not know better, l would swear Rod Serling was being channelled from the afterlife and this was an extended epilogue from a Twilight Zone episode. Different century, same issues."
827,It feels like Stone is really projecting how he wants Putin to be. I think Lex nailed it when asked about how the charisma of a leader could affect Stone's point of view.
828,"This is an amazing interview. I live in America. I had no idea what has been happening in Ukraine since 2014. I had no idea about the death squads or censorship. I wondered why Putin compared them to nazis, but now I know. I have fresh eyes on the situation. America and the west and NATO and their push toward Russia. Thank you for this interview Lex. I find it eye opening. Things are making more sense. There is a side to the story that we Americans are not being told. I'm shocked. I'm upset. I'm sad. I've been lied to. The treacherous dealers have dealt very very treacherously. My mind goes to Bible prophecy. Norway, Sweden, Finland. The three ribs in the Bible. Amazing. Thank you, thank you, thank you Lex. Amazing interview!"
829,"Sorry, this interview has made me totally loose any ounce of respect I had for Stone. Fawning over a dictator that is invading a country and killing civilians... jeez man."
830,"Gorbachev, what a naive man. He was a joke and so easily fooled by his western counterparts."
831,The Ukrainian military increased the shelling of the DLNR 40x in the last days before Russia invaded. I think it was seen as a preparation for an attack.But either way it was a situation that had to be dealt with.

835,"Its really interesting how Stone repeatedly speaks to the importance, of nation states maintaining there sovereignty. Yet he can‚Äôt see that Ukraine and the Ukrainians have a legitimate interest, in not being subjugated by Russia."
836,"omg... oliver stone lives in a nutty reality; he doesn't remember names (""medvedev""; ""that great newspaper in russia"", etc, etc...).
unreal. the man is embarrassing.

again, oliver stone is beyond nuts."
837,"If Ukraine was neutral as Oliver Stone puts it,  Yanukovych wouldn't have fled to Russia to live in a big a$$ house in 2014.
He is more accurate on his historical views of the United States, but his views on Russia n Ukraine are all over the place."
838,jeeze Oliver in love with Putin much ?
839,"His love of Putin is quite shocking to me, who invaded whom, both times Mr. Stone?  I was also surprised at his use of ‚Äúwhat about Ian‚Äù as justification in support of Putin."
840,@nuclear power or rather decarbonization - the coal may be a different but oil and gas do not get used in energy only but serve also as a chemicals in certain technological processes that are crucial for us and difficult to replace. As for methane - there are deposits which will be released if temp. raises and we can use that to burn. Once burnt there is no methane but (assuming effecting oxidation of clean gas) we get co2 and h2o and heat. That is it. You could use the nuclear and to lesser extent so called renewables to produce synthetic fuels from CO2 that would be best as the bateries and H2 as energy storage are really bad which in case of H2 is not going to improve due to physics of it and in case of bateries it is going to end up with physical limitations too just the physics and chemistry are more complex and there is always hope to get it better). But this is another discussion altogether.  The point is that nuclear is not the end of it. We need follow up tech not because of the greens and climate but because the hydrocarbons are also limited so at some point it will be necessary. The nuclear with the currently most popular technology (water pressureised) is just a dead end. There are others that seem to beeasier to get into passive safety as well as burning more of the fuel that the current ones do leaving less waste in a pocess too.
841,stone seems to have either forgotten or conveniently overlooked the massive nuclear waste problem.
842,"Ollie needs to move to Russia. He had me with some of his conspiracies, but lost me with the US using Nukes and chemicals to blame Russia."
843,"The extreme lack of historical knowledge needed to buy what Oliver Stone is selling regarding Putin is hilarious. I watched his documentary and the historical section is frankly comedy for me to watch, i.e convieniently not mentioning how the holodomor made Ukrainians despise Russia (which explains why some joined the Nazis once they came onto their land). Another example is how the molotov ribentropp pact was not described as a Soviet-German pact but some kind of ""European"" pact. It's absolutely laughable how generously it portrays the Soviets then, and thus Russia now, since Putin is trying to rewrite history for his own propaganda purposes. If you believe what Oliver has to say about Putin it's a wonder you didn't walk into traffic while growing up - you give the word moron a new meaning."
844,"Portola Expedition when it crossed the Santa Ana River near about experienced an earth quake...study now thinks it was 7...I'm very glad San Onofre shut down, though stored rods are there...tidal waves, wars...we can go back to pre industrial ways and means...see Robert Graves New Crete...too many too wealthy...an industrial world is not what we are, we're not cyborgs...we dont need technology...ü¶Ñ"
845,"Writing from France: I used to watch the French version of RT (Russia Today) which struck me as generally very good and never felt like just a Russian propaganda mouth-piece. It presented an alternative point of view, often more nuanced than MSM. I was shocked that it was suddenly pulled on the say-so of a just a few voices somewhere within the EU power structure. There are still some alternative French sources that present a much more balanced view on the war in Ukraine, notably Xavier Moreau on STRATPOL who spent 15 years in Russia and has many contacts in both Russia and Ukraine. The French mainstream news is no better than the US mainstream in that they have a set narrative to push (whether they believe it or not) lest they be seen an apologists for Putin."

847,"I appreciate this podcast for providing a different viewpoint on the ongoing situation.
What I do feel is that it may have helped a bit more to start at a bit lower level and then move up. 
With this I mean that Oliver Stone mentions things like a nazi regime in Ukraine, Russia being defensive and not imperialistic and the United States being threatening towards Russia. 

While I do see that, as a European getting only second-hand information from news sources and the internet, my perception on this conflict is biased, some of these elements make it hard for me to follow his arguments or views, as I cannot comprehend the concepts they are based upon. 

For instance, when mentioning Ukraine aggression in the Eastern regions from 2014-2022 as something that is missed by the western media, I can sort of see that, however I feel this can be seen largely in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Obviously a sovereign country that is under active invasion will display aggression in order to defend itself. 
This brings me to the mention of Russia not being imperialistic; from recent memory (keep in mind I'm in my 20s and thus only somewhat familiar with the 21st century events), Russia has been the only country that has been invading other countries (be it Georgia or twice Ukraine now). To me there is no place and should be no tolerance world wide for invading another country in the 21st century, so I cannot understand how the facts of these invasions can be aligned with the statement of Russia not being imperialistic. 

I would love to see more coverage of these initial concepts such that I can have a better understanding of them later on, especially since this is the very first time in my life where I am encountering a situation where I just cannot grasp the goodness on the other side and that scares me, as there should be. However in my current belief, one cannot justify invading another country nor assimilating any territory of another country, furthermore I have never sensed any desire from anyone in the west to invade Russia (imperialism is not of this age anymore and we'd much rather work together), so these ideas that NATO is threatening Russia are strange to me as the entire point of NATO seems to be to prevent situations like this where Russia is consciously continuously deciding to cause pain, suffering and death to thousands of ordinary civilians. 

Anyway, I feel like I am rambling which I do not want to do, as I don't feel like bringing up my whole perspective is very useful in this comment section. Instead I hope that you can provide more content like this, as I think it's very useful, however maybe make sure that concepts on which controversial arguments are built are better explored at the start. Which I can also understand may be hard to do, as everyone's level of understanding is at a different place so it's hard to find a good starting point. 

That said, great podcast, thanks again for the content Lex. 
I hope this comment is not seen in any negative light towards anyone within the podcasts or anyone's world view who may be reading this. I wanted to share a bit of my current understanding to show how some concepts argued may be too big a leap for me to understand from where I am at, which makes it hard for me to fully understand some the rest."
848,"Brilliant and certainly refreshing, in light of the restricted news media in the U.S.  I read ""Russian Dissidents"" on Substack, and many of these young bloggers feel that Mr. Putin does favor certain oligarchs and enjoys popularity with pensioners and the middle class only.  Younger, better educated Russians do not share any enthusiasm for this Ukraine war and hold Mr. Putin accountable for advancing this ""Z"" agenda.   Again, thank you for this   presentation."
849,Great interview.  Oliver Stone is a clearly a socialist but his points are well made about the West‚Äôs miscalculated and arrogant approach to dealing with the USSR and Russia.  Listening to this discussion made me assess the two opposing systems of society and economics. Clearly communism is an unsuccessful system but it‚Äôs also true that unbridled capitalism without a moral populace has clear problems as well.
850,What is wrong with them? A microphone holder and a old man that has been wine and dined to much by Putin?
851,The British mercenary arrested by Russia had a notebook on his person. In it were co-ordinates for a mass grave for 280 civilians murdered.
852,An example that one can be so smart and so stupid simultaneously~
853,"It's funny how people always assume the ruling elite elsewhere is different.
They care about the people & the country and the rest of it, like they were saints from the parallel, better universe.
If you believe that up to your forties, fair enough, but beyond that point it's hilarious ... ü§£"
854,Oliver Stone is an outstanding human being and certainly he knows what he's talking about when he talks about the US way of dominating the world but the way he describes Putin and the responsibilities of the current aberrant devastation an death Putin and his partners (Chechens...) are committing in Ukraine is shoking. I hope he'll change his perspective in the future.
855,"With the utmost respect I fail to agree with Mr. Stone re: nuclear energy. He makes the mistake of assessing the danger of nuclear energy on terms of people killed in nuclear accidents. The much greater danger and devastating threat is to the bio-sphere. Fukushima's continuing disaster for example threatens the entire  northern  Pacific ocean basin. Mines tailings just as Chernobyl become wastelands. Consequently, no Mr. Stone I do not agree with you nor do I agree with Patrick Moore who is no longer associated with Greenpeace. Not until we have exhausted development of more innocuous methods. What is holding back widespread expansion of geothermal?"
856,"DPR: Residents of Svetlodarsk recount robberies and rapes committed by Ukrainian soldiers
by Christelle Neant.
 On May 27, 2022, we were in Svetlodarsk, just days after the takeover of the city by Russian forces and those of the People's Militia of the LPR (Lugansk People's Republic).  The inhabitants told us about the eight years under the yoke of Ukraine, and the crimes (thefts and rapes) committed by the Ukrainian soldiers against the civilian population.
 Before arriving in town, we pass by the former positions of the Ukrainian army, in front of Debaltsevo.  We find a lot of waste there, including a large number of syringes that suggest that the Ukrainian soldiers took drugs.  A guess that will be confirmed by the residents of Svetlodarsk.  A lady tells us how in the middle of a discussion, an obviously drugged Ukrainian soldier suddenly took out a knife and started to cut through the air with it, in a trance.
 In the center of Svetlodarsk, near the shops, we find a large number of locals, who have a lot to tell about the crimes of Ukrainian soldiers and the complicity of the OSCE.  There are so many people who want to tell us what they have experienced, seen and heard, that the interview is difficult.  Everyone absolutely wants to tell such and such a fact, which seems important to him, even if it means cutting off the person who is speaking.
 Unanimously, all the inhabitants met said they were happy to have seen the arrival of the Russian army and the people's militia of the LPR.  When I report to them the accusations of war crimes that the Ukrainian and Western media are peddling against Russian soldiers, they all respond in unison that they are lies.  The population of Svetlodarsk has nothing to reproach the Russian soldiers or those of the LPR.
 On the other hand, it is not the same with those of the Ukrainian army.  The inhabitants of Svetlodarsk tell us for almost an hour about the robberies and rapes committed by Ukrainian soldiers.
 As soon as they arrived in Svetlodarsk in 2014, Ukrainian soldiers stole rings, chains, and even Christian crosses.  They also stole metal gates, plasma televisions, furniture, doors, electrical outlets, and many other things, which they then sent home through the ""new post"" office.
 And the Ukrainian soldiers not only robbed the residents of Svetlodarsk, they also raped young women and girls.  One of the women interviewed, Praskovia, tells us how, in 2018, Ukrainian soldiers drove away and raped her who is now her stepdaughter, when she was only 16 years old.  Luckily they find her quickly, and alive.
 Another woman, Natalia, recounts how they robbed the cigarette and vodka section of the store where she worked, gun in hand, before stealing the jewelery of the young woman who worked in this section, Irina, then raping her.
 Natalia, and her friend Viktoria, also tell us how Ukrainian soldiers landed in a house where there was an invalid woman in bed, and her daughter who was taking care of her.  They raped the young girl in front of her mother, before killing her.
 Praskovia also told us that the Right Sector fighters had organized a real delivery system for young women.  They were caught in town, then taken by car to their headquarters, where they were raped.
This testimony reminds me of that of Natacha, a survivor of a Right Sector prison.  She had told us how Ukrainian fighters raped prisoners in chains.
 In addition to robbing and raping, Ukrainian soldiers killed civilians, never being charged for these crimes.  So a Ukrainian tank literally drove over a car in which there was a family.  The four occupants, including two children, died instantly.
 Residents of Svetlodarsk also told us how Ukrainian soldiers were shelling them, or each other, with the complicity of the OSCE, which then declared that the shots came from Gorlovka, when the direction of origin of the shells was  totally inconsistent with this assertion.
 The OSCE, which also turned a blind eye to the heavy weapon fire conducted from the Ukrainian soldiers' base, where we found four holes for howitzers and self-propelled guns and numerous shell casings proving that these artillery pieces had fired since that  location, which is close to the observers office!  However, Svetlodarsk was in the zone of withdrawal of heavy weapons provided for by the Minsk agreements.
Evidence of OSCE complicity in Ukrainian military crimes mounts: organization employees transmitting location data of People's Militia units, satellite phone bearing their logo found in Azovstal  , and the discovery of software in the computers of Ukrainian soldiers allowing them to control the surveillance cameras installed by the organization on the front line.
It will be difficult after all this to make people believe that the OSCE was a neutral organization, which faithfully reported violations of the ceasefire in Donbass.  This organization turned a blind eye for eight years to the violations of the Minsk agreements by Ukrainian soldiers, just as the West turned a blind eye to the crimes committed by these same soldiers against the population of Donbass."
857,"Sad to see such a gifted director being completely consumed by Russian propaganda - he's not said a single negative thing about Russia in this interview - there's no perfect country.  Stone sees himself as a rebel - he's happy as long as he's swimming against the mainstream, that's his trademark and he'll uphold this whatever it takes."
858,Wait ... Putin had cancer and Covid19?
859,"Oliver paints Putin as a great sensible person, fair, and collective leader but Putins actions üé¨ don't match to his description. Actions speak louder than words."
860,"Oliver Stones seems to be reasonable person. I agree with him on many things like energy, however when he start to talk about Ukraine he is making the same mistake as he criticize before. He haven't been in Ukraine since 80s and he is saying that since 2014 they are a terrorist state? He was saying that Ukraine had 100 thousands and more soldiers ready in February to take Donbass? sorry this is just non sense. Russia had armies ready for months. Attract was done even cowardly from Belorussian territory. The arrears of Ukraine are going to be annexed most probably Ukrainian language banned. People have been deported to Russia and on occupied territories many civilians have been killed by Russian troops. I am so sorry to heard such words from Oliver Stone."
861,"Very strange.
Interesting to see a different perspective, although I highly disagree with Stone's view of the world. Very one sided, close minded and clearly focusing on influencing the listener or making him look knowledgeable instead of discussing facts. He just disses the US when he can...
Also sounds like he enjoys the conflict, encouraging it, making it normal. Very strange compared to other interviewees, yet I guess it tells us there is people like him, and likely in power."
862,"As a russia speaking Ukrainian from Luhansk (Donbas), this podcast was physically hard to listen to till the end. It took me several attempts. The second part was especially painful.

I don‚Äôt think that a person who is openly admiring putin and has conducted 4 interviews with him, and the one who has never been to (independent) Ukraine, can have a balanced viewpoint. 
There are some russians in Ukraine, true. But most russian-speaking people are Ukrainians. That‚Äôs the same mistake that Putin made when he expected support from the population.
‚ÄúUkraine invading Donbas‚Äù? Really? Invading itself? Is that a thing now?
Nationalists controlling Zelensky? Dude, their party didn‚Äôt make it to the parliament, the have (or at least had,
pre-war) almost no support.

And Lex, in your next episode with Stephen Kotkin, you said that you‚Äôre afraid to come to Ukraine. Don‚Äôt be :) That‚Äôs your russian genes triggering, not Ukrainian. We don‚Äôt kill people for their believes, we take the weapons only when someone brings the war to us.
Thank you for both episodes though. Listening to opposing views is a lost art these days."
863,Wow. Oliver Stone sounds like a Russian ambassador. He also apparently thinks Putin is great man and a great leader. I'm floored by this interview. Just wow.
864,"I remember reading a lot about Putin's origins background political or should i say military positions but of a few past years he has seemed to me to hold-back; to say ""hold on' /as if we need to step back/ wait a little. he seemed so conservative and circumspect. He doesn't strike me as making rash trouble and certainly not like the American past examples. does he threaten?   I havent been watching this issue  i'm sorry. And I don't know the history of Ukrain but didn't  Russia invade Ukrain before? I thought didn't this happen a ong time ago? say about 1950' /60s? Please would someone direct me to some answer sources. So why don't they arbitrate or live where they want to live and... Gosh are we all headed downhill!"
865,Olive Stone is a state treasure and a pivotal legend.  The US is lucky to have him speaking the truth at the risk of his neck.
866,"I didnt agree everything what Stone had to say about russia as the nicest country or the USSR in general. He only interviewed Putin for hours and putin can play along of course! I have just watched an interview with Simon Sebag Montefiore this morning about Stalin. Stalin is the nicest human being to his friends and family but the archives of his letters and all documents tells a different story about him and Russia. So I dont believe everything what Stone said about Russia and Putin. Of course hes making a movie not a historian. Historians dig all the hidden documents from the archives and interview everybody who revolves around the person. Stone always have a desdain in america yet he lives in america because he cant live in Russia or cuba. Again Stone's opinion is one sided and its just his opinion, nothing else."
867,Oliver Stone must be living in his own world at times detached from reality.
868,"While agreeing with, and positively valuing your opinions, Oliver Stone, I just can't understand how you didn't see through the fake and thin character of Joe Biden and voted for him. Yes, Trump has his problems and his character rubs many people the wrong way, but at least you know he is honest with himself and with his interest to do the best he can for America."
869,"Guys, nothing from he's saying about Ukraine's internal politics and what goes on here is true. Based on this I don't see much reason in believing his words about other topics."
870,Same few individuals in the comments criticizing Stone are the same ones that believe WMD actually existed in Iraq
871,I am Swedish and live in Sweden. the fact is that ukraine is a country of its own. Russia has invaded that country. we are not invading other countries and we do not want to hear Putin's excuses. it is not a complex subject
872,"""...but he's not making a big deal of it"" wtf?!"
873,"What Oliver says about the US projection of imperialism by Russia is so true. It's the US that is frequently either covertly or openly occupying other countries for its own benefit.
Another great interview, Lex. Thank-you!"
874,Oliver Stone is so right about the sovereignty of the European countries. Here in The Netherlands we have politicians who say that we have to give up our sovereignty for the greater EU. We are loosing our countries like we knew them.
875,Oliver Stone is new Sergei Lavrov (minister of foreign affairs of russia). Lex Fridman you builded scenario of interview as ruzzi state propaganda thesises
876,"The most important thing for westerners is to realize what their origin is: they are Caucasian. Derrived from Kaukaz, a region in modern day Russia. Dear white westerners, you are by origin white Slavic Russians. Think about that for a minute."
877,"The numbers of people who ""died at Chernobyl"" are Soviet numbers that the IAEA keeps parrotting. The same goes for the 96% of fuel that supposedly didn't get released into the environment. This has never been verified by independent researchers and has been disputed by Russian scientists who actually conducted expeditions on site, into areas which are supposedly impossible to enter safely. 

Even if the official numbers would add up, it also doesn't make much sense to only count those people that directly died as a result, if hundreds of thousands in the wider area have been/are being negatively affected by this incident to this day. 

Meanwhile it is estimated that Japan will need to spend tens of billions of dollars into the clean up of Fukushima. Money (and energy) that needs to be factored in to an already very expensive form of generating electricity. Not to mention the economic fallout of having had to abandon the region.

As long as this is how the safety record of nuclear power looks like I don't feel comfortable doubling or tripling the global numbers of reactors, which would be necessary to pose a relevant alternative in our energy consumption. Not that this would be realistic anyway because the price for uranium would skyrocket as a result, of which Russia is one of the major global suppliers btw.

Yes, molten salt thorium reactors seem nice. Too bad that they aren't even being supported by the nuclear industry and that we are still waiting for the first couple of modern test reactors."
878,Patton was killed because he called out the evil
879,"I agree that there indeed is a lot of propaganda about the war in the west, in my opinion the cheerleading for the Ukraine has gone unrealistic.

I don't agree with Russia in ANY WAY, and as a Finn I'm only happy when Russia is weakened, but for once I'd like to hear about the Ukrainian losses in a realistic manner.  And this might be politically incorrect to say, but I've become to really be annoyed about Zelenskyy constantly being in all of the media and telling us we should be ashamed for not giving Ukraine everything it needs.

I am from Finland, and back in the day we fought the Russian invasion ALONE, without any considerable outside help, and we fought for longer than Ukraine has now fought Russia with all kinds of help.

I have deep sympathies for the Ukrainians, but stop f**king guilt-tripping us. Ukraine is not a part of NATO, so it better not act like one. Why should us Finns consider being a part of NATO, if unlimited weapons supply is provided without being in the alliance? Well, I nevertheless hope they get what they need, I was just venting about this thing.

Again, I hate Russia, but there nevertheless has to be a limit for Ukraine as well. Or at least the Ukrainians could start being grateful in their public appearances, instead of just demanding more.

After all what I said I'm, sure nobody thinks I'm being genuine when I say:

Slava Unkarini!"
880,"This interviewer is naive and overlooking what is happening on the ground daily on film even in Ukraine.  CRUX on Yutube from Indian, where the tradition of free critical press is still respected, and they remain neutral on Ukraine,  they say that  so many have been tortured and murdered in the basement of a law enforcement building--untold huge numbers.   Ukraine is not ""Americanizing"" the violence against its people and civilians and sovereignty.   I have run into very convincing sociopaths in working with people the courts take an interest in and they lie with such ease and joviality...and some can remember their lies and use lies strategically or just for their entertainment.  And I have seen good lawyers I thought were moral (not sure) but they lied easily and changed quickly when the object of their charm went out the door.  A totally new person sat before me with totally different views.  Charm can totally deceive and this interviewer is totally naive and strikes me that way.  My opinion is based on doing many interviews myself...and it is hard to verify what they say especially if it is historical."
881,At least he's honest. He's pro Russian. I give him that.
882,"Yeah, Russia has a FANTASTIC RECORD WITH ATOMIC POWER!!!

Love you Oliver - but you're not gonna be the guy suffering from some fucked up nuke plant - you jump on a jet. 
Your aristocratic upbringing is showing."
883,"So, while I like some of Oliver's views, his downplaying of communism and the anti-soviet thinking was ridiculous. Communism was destroying countries from the early 1900s, it was the most brutal cruelty seen in human history, the holodomor is unbelievably heartbreaking.. now that wasn't ""russian"" but specifically bolshevik/jewish, and it's important to say that distinction because the russian people were oppressed under them. The 1960s protests were absolutely connected to those same bolsheviks which we are now seeing again, their brainwashing in universities have absolutely subverted society slowly just as ex KGB agent Yuri Bezmenov spoke about. Be careful with absorbing his views, because some are very inaccurate.."
884,Why would Anyone give a Rats Ass what Ollie Rock has to say about anything other than making Fictional movies? Damn.ü§£ü§£ü§£
885,"This great director should try sometime to make films about Afganistan, Chechnya, Pridnestrovie, Georgia. About Politkovskaya, Nemtzov, Kara-Murza, Magnitsky, Litvinenko, Skripali, Navalny, Babchenko, and many-many others. Hundreds and thousands people tortured and thrown to the prison, to make a film based on the gigabytes of footage showing tortures in Russian prisons. Or he is just too well paid to turn a blind eye on all these atrocities?üòÇ"
886,instalike for opening statement
887,When things contradict what he wants to say he just says I don‚Äôt know the answer to that that‚Äôs not really good enough you know
888,"This is a really disappointing interview, Stone seems delusional like the rest of Putins surrounding. I really enjoyed his podcast with Joe Rogan and I understand his criticism of the West. But dear Mr. Stone, if you advice us to be open minded, how come you speak like a russian propagandist and fail to criticize Russia with all it's flaws but rather praising  it for 2 hours with a voice a wise old Philosopher?"
889,After him saying that Putins idea is to keep world in peace and harmony.. I turned it off. What kind of illusion is he in?
890,Liked and subscribed. Thanks for sharing.

When Stone said controversal things, i was always waiting for push-back (as expected frm other media) - but Lex keeps calm, and just keeps asking to understand the reasoning. Not judgemental, but allowing for his audience to get the full thought process of the interviewee. The audience can judge. Thanks for that. I would have loved to hear Lex interviewing some of the dubious and controversal historic figures, politicians, dictators and generals. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!"
